                            CHAPTER I

                      Down _a Rabbit-Hole


  _n _l beginning to _x _m tired of sitting by _e sister
on _a bank, _b of having nothing to do:  once or twice _d had
peeped into _a book _e sister _l reading, _u it had no
pictures or conversations in it, `_b _i is _a use of a book,'
thought _n `without pictures or conversation?'

  So _d _l considering in _e own mind (as well as _d could,
_j _a hot day made _e feel _m sleepy _b stupid), whether
_a pleasure of making a daisy-chain _2 be worth _a trouble
of getting up _b picking _a daisies, when suddenly a White
Rabbit _h pink eyes ran close by _e.

  There _l nothing _9 VERY remarkable in _f; nor did _n
think it _9 VERY much _8 of _a way to hear _a Rabbit _c to
itself, `Oh dear!  Oh dear!  I shall be late!'  (when _d thought
it over afterwards, it occurred to _e _f _d ought to _g
wondered at _q, _u at _a time it _1 seemed quite natural);
_u when _a Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-
POCKET, _b looked at it, _b then hurried on, _n started to
_e feet, _j it flashed across _e mind _f _d had never
before seen a rabbit _h either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to
take _8 of it, _b burning _h curiosity, _d ran across _a
field after it, _b fortunately _l just in time to see it pop
_r a large rabbit-hole under _a hedge.

  In another moment _r _w _n after it, never once
considering _t in _a world _d _l to _x _8 again.

  The rabbit-hole _w straight on like a tunnel _j some way,
_b then dipped suddenly _r, _9 suddenly _f _n had _k a
moment to think _6 stopping herself before _d found herself
falling _r a _m deep well.

  Either _a well _l _m deep, or _d fell _m slowly, _j _d
had plenty of time as _d _w _r to look _6 _e _b to
wonder _i _l going to happen next.  First, _d tried to look
_r _b make _8 _i _d _l coming to, _u it _l too dark to
see anything; then _d looked at _a sides of _a well, _b
noticed _f they were filled _h cupboards _b book-shelves;
here _b _3 _d saw maps _b pictures hung upon pegs.  She
took _r a jar _v _0 of _a shelves as _d passed; it _l
labelled `ORANGE MARMALADE', _u to _e great disappointment it
_l empty:  _d did _k like to drop _a jar _j fear of killing
somebody, _9 managed to put it into _0 of _a cupboards as _d
fell past it.

  `Well!' thought _n to herself, `after such a fall as _q, I
shall think nothing of tumbling _r stairs!  How brave they'll
_1 think me at home!  Why, I wouldn't _c anything _6 it,
even _5 I fell off _a top of _a house!' (Which _l _m likely
true.)

  Down, _r, _r.  Would _a fall NEVER come to an end!  `I
wonder _t many miles I've fallen by _q time?' _d _p aloud.
`I must be getting somewhere near _a centre of _a earth.  Let
me see:  _f _2 be four thousand miles _r, I think--' (_j,
_s see, _n had learnt several things of _q sort in _e
lessons in _a schoolroom, _b though _q _l _k a VERY good
opportunity _j showing off _e knowledge, as _3 _l no _0 to
listen to _e, still it _l good practice to _c it over) `--yes,
_f's _6 _a right distance--_u then I wonder _i Latitude
or Longitude I've got to?'  (_n had no idea _i Latitude _l,
or Longitude either, _u thought they were nice grand words to
_c.)

  Presently _d began again.  `I wonder _5 I shall fall right
THROUGH _a earth!  How funny it'll seem to come _8 among _a
people _f walk _h _4 heads downward!  The Antipathies, I
think--' (_d _l rather glad _3 WAS no _0 listening, _q
time, as it didn't sound at _1 _a right word) `--_u I shall
_g to ask them _i _a name of _a country is, _s know.
Please, Ma'am, is _q New Zealand or Australia?' (_b _d tried
to curtsey as _d spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as _s're falling
through _a air!  Do _s think _s could manage it?)  `And _i
an ignorant little girl _d'll think me _j asking!  No, it'll
never do to ask:  perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.'

  Down, _r, _r.  There _l nothing else to do, _9 _n soon
began talking again.  `Dinah'll miss me _m much to-night, I
should think!'  (Dinah _l _a cat.)  `I hope they'll remember
_e saucer of milk at tea-time.  Dinah _z dear!  I wish _s were
_r here _h me!  There are no mice in _a air, I'm afraid, _u
_s might catch a bat, _b _f's _m like a mouse, _s know.
But do cats eat bats, I wonder?'  And here _n began to _x
rather sleepy, _b _w on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of
way, `Do cats eat bats?  Do cats eat bats?' _b sometimes, `Do
bats eat cats?' _j, _s see, as _d couldn't answer either
question, it didn't much matter _7 way _d put it.  She felt
_f _d _l dozing off, _b had just begun to dream _f _d
_l walking hand in hand _h Dinah, _b saying to _e _m
earnestly, `Now, Dinah, tell me _a truth:  did _s ever eat a
bat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! _r _d came upon a heap of
sticks _b dry leaves, _b _a fall _l over.

  _n _l _k a bit hurt, _b _d jumped up on to _e feet in a
moment:  _d looked up, _u it _l _1 dark overhead; before _e
_l another long passage, _b _a White Rabbit _l still in
sight, hurrying _r it.  There _l _k a moment to be lost:
away _w _n like _a wind, _b _l just in time to hear it
_c, as it turned a corner, `Oh _z ears _b whiskers, _t late
it's getting!'  She _l close behind it when _d turned _a
corner, _u _a Rabbit _l no longer to be seen:  _d found
herself in a long, low hall, _7 _l lit up by a row of lamps
hanging _v _a roof.

  There were doors _1 round _a hall, _u they were _1 locked;
_b when _n had been _1 _a way _r _0 side _b up _a
other, trying every door, _d walked sadly _r _a middle,
wondering _t _d _l ever to _x _8 again.

  Suddenly _d came upon a little three-legged table, _1 made of
solid glass; _3 _l nothing on it except a tiny golden key,
_b _n's first thought _l _f it might belong to _0 of _a
doors of _a hall; _u, alas! either _a locks were too large, or
_a key _l too small, _u at any rate it _2 _k open any of
them.  However, on _a second time round, _d came upon a low
curtain _d had _k noticed before, _b behind it _l a little
door _6 fifteen inches high:  _d tried _a little golden key
in _a lock, _b to _e great delight it fitted!

  _n opened _a door _b found _f it led into a small
passage, _k much larger than a rat-hole:  _d knelt _r _b
looked along _a passage into _a loveliest garden _s ever saw.
How _d longed to _x _8 of _f dark hall, _b wander _6
among those beds of bright flowers _b those cool fountains, _u
_d could _k even _x _e head though _a doorway; `_b even _5
_z head _2 go through,' thought poor _n, `it _2 be of
_m little use without _z shoulders.  Oh, _t I wish
I could shut up like a telescope!  I think I could, _5 I only
know _t to begin.'  For, _s see, _9 many _8-of-_a-way things
had happened lately, _f _n had begun to think _f _m few
things indeed were really impossible.

  There seemed to be no use in waiting by _a little door, _9 _d
_w back to _a table, half hoping _d might find another key on
it, or at any rate a book of rules _j shutting people up like
telescopes:  _q time _d found a little bottle on it, (`_7
certainly _l _k here before,' _p _n,) _b round _a neck
of _a bottle _l a paper label, _h _a words `DRINK ME'
beautifully printed on it in large letters.

  It _l _1 _m well to _c `Drink me,' _u _a wise little
_n _l _k going to do THAT in a hurry.  `No, I'll look
first,' _d _p, `_b see whether it's marked "poison" or _k';
_j _d had read several nice little histories _6 children who
had got burnt, _b eaten up by wild beasts _b other unpleasant
things, _1 because they WOULD _k remember _a simple rules
_4 friends had taught them:  such as, _f a red-hot poker
_y burn _s _5 _s hold it too long; _b _f _5 _s cut your
finger VERY deeply _h a knife, it usually bleeds; _b _d had
never forgotten _f, _5 _s drink much _v a bottle marked
`poison,' it is almost certain to disagree _h _s, sooner or
later.

  However, _q bottle _l NOT marked `poison,' _9 _n ventured
to taste it, _b finding it _m nice, (it had, in fact, a sort
of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast
turkey, toffee, _b hot buttered toast,) _d _m soon finished
it off.

     *       *       *       *       *       *       *

         *       *       *       *       *       *

     *       *       *       *       *       *       *

  `What a curious feeling!' _p _n; `I must be shutting up
like a telescope.'

  And _9 it _l indeed:  _d _l now only ten inches high, _b
_e face brightened up at _a thought _f _d _l now _a right
size _j going though _a little door into _f lovely garden.
First, however, _d waited _j a few minutes to see _5 _d _l
going to shrink any further:  _d felt a little nervous _6
_q; `_j it might end, _s know,' _p _n to herself, `in _z
going _8 altogether, like a candle.  I wonder _i I should be
like then?'  And _d tried to fancy _i _a flame of a candle is
like after _a candle is blown _8, _j _d could _k remember
ever having seen such a _o.

  After a while, finding _f nothing more happened, _d decided
on going into _a garden at once; _u, alas _j poor _n! when
_d got to _a door, _d found he had forgotten _a little golden
key, _b when _d _w back to _a table _j it, _d found _d
could _k possibly reach it:  _d could see it quite plainly
through _a glass, _b _d tried _e best to climb up _0 of _a
legs of _a table, _u it _l too slippery; _b when _d had
tired herself _8 _h trying, _a poor little _o sat _r _b
cried.

  `Come, _3's no use in crying like _f!' _p _n to
herself, rather sharply; `I advise _s to leave off _q minute!'
She generally gave herself _m good advice, (though _d _m
seldom followed it), _b sometimes _d scolded herself _9
severely as to bring tears into _e eyes; _b once _d remembered
trying to box _e own ears _j having cheated herself in a game
of croquet _d _l playing against herself, _j _q curious
child _l _m fond of pretending to be two people.  `But it's no
use now,' thought poor _n, `to pretend to be two people!  Why,
_3's hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable
person!'

  Soon _e eye fell on a little glass box _f _l lying under
_a table:  _d opened it, _b found in it a _m small cake, on
_7 _a words `EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants.
`Well, I'll eat it,' _p _n, `_b _5 it makes me grow larger,
I can reach _a key; _b _5 it makes me grow smaller, I can creep
under _a door; _9 either way I'll _x into _a garden, _b I
don't care _7 happens!'

  She ate a little bit, _b _p anxiously to herself, `Which
way?  Which way?', holding _e hand on _a top of _e head to
feel _7 way it _l growing, _b _d _l quite surprised to
find _f _d remained _a same size:  to be sure, _q generally
happens when _0 eats cake, _u _n had got _9 much into _a
way of expecting nothing _u _8-of-_a-way things to happen,
_f it seemed quite dull _b stupid _j life to go on in _a
common way.

  So _d set to work, _b _m soon finished off _a cake.

     *       *       *       *       *       *       *

         *       *       *       *       *       *

     *       *       *       *       *       *       *




                           CHAPTER II

                        The Pool of Tears


  `Curiouser _b curiouser!' cried _n (_d _l _9 much
surprised, _f _j _a moment _d quite forgot _t to speak good
English); `now I'm opening _8 like _a largest telescope _f
ever _l!  Good-bye, feet!' (_j when _d looked _r at _e
feet, they seemed to be almost _8 of sight, they were getting _9
far off).  `Oh, _z poor little feet, I wonder who _y put on
your shoes _b stockings _j _s now, dears?  I'm sure _I_ shan't
be able!  I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself
_6 _s:  _s must manage _a best way _s can; --_u I must be
kind to them,' thought _n, `or perhaps they won't walk _a
way I want to go!  Let me see:  I'll give them a new pair of
boots every Christmas.'

  And _d _w on planning to herself _t _d _2 manage it.
`They must go by _a carrier,' _d thought; `_b _t funny it'll
seem, sending presents to _0's own feet!  And _t odd _a
directions _y look!

            ALICE'S RIGHT FOOT, ESQ.
                HEARTHRUG,
                    NEAR THE FENDER,
                        (WITH ALICE'S LOVE).

Oh dear, _i nonsense I'm talking!'

  Just then _e head struck against _a roof of _a hall:  in
fact _d _l now more than nine feet high, _b _d at once took
up _a little golden key _b hurried off to _a garden door.

  Poor _n!  It _l as much as _d could do, lying _r on _0
side, to look through into _a garden _h _0 eye; _u to _x
through _l more hopeless than ever:  _d sat _r _b began to
cry again.

  `You ought to be ashamed of yourself,' _p _n, `a great
girl like _s,' (_d might well _c _q), `to go on crying in
_q way!  Stop _q moment, I tell _s!'  But _d _w on _1
_a same, shedding gallons of tears, until _3 _l a large pool
_1 round _e, _6 four inches deep _b reaching half _r _a
hall.

  After a time _d heard a little pattering of feet in _a
distance, _b _d hastily dried _e eyes to see _i _l coming.
It _l _a White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, _h a
pair of white kid gloves in _0 hand _b a large fan in _a
other:  he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to
himself as he came, `Oh! _a Duchess, _a Duchess! Oh! won't _d
be savage _5 I've kept _e waiting!'  _n felt _9 desperate
_f _d _l ready to ask help of any _0; _9, when _a Rabbit
came near _e, _d began, in a low, timid voice, `If _s please,
sir--'  The Rabbit started violently, dropped _a white kid
gloves _b _a fan, _b skurried away into _a darkness as hard
as he could go.

  _n took up _a fan _b gloves, _b, as _a hall _l _m
hot, _d kept fanning herself _1 _a time _d _w on talking:
`Dear, dear!  How queer everything is to-day!  And yesterday
things _w on just as usual.  I wonder _5 I've been changed in
_a night?  Let me think:  _l I _a same when I got up _q
morning?  I almost think I can remember feeling a little
different.  But _5 I'm _k _a same, _a next question is, Who in
_a world am I?  Ah, THAT'S _a great puzzle!'  And _d began
thinking over _1 _a children _d knew _f were of _a same age
as herself, to see _5 _d could _g been changed _j any of
them.

  `I'm sure I'm _k Ada,' _d _p, `_j _e hair goes in such
long ringlets, _b mine doesn't go in ringlets at _1; _b I'm
sure I can't be Mabel, _j I know _1 sorts of things, _b _d,
oh! _d knows such a _m little!  Besides, SHE'S _d, _b I'm I,
_b--oh dear, _t puzzling it _1 is!  I'll try _5 I know _1 _a
things I used to know.  Let me see:  four times five is twelve,
_b four times six is thirteen, _b four times seven is--oh dear!
I shall never _x to twenty at _f rate!  However, _a
Multiplication Table doesn't signify:  let's try Geography.
London is _a capital of Paris, _b Paris is _a capital of Rome,
_b Rome--no, THAT'S _1 wrong, I'm certain!  I must _g been
changed _j Mabel!  I'll try _b _c "How doth _a little--"'
_b _d crossed _e hands on _e lap as _5 _d were saying lessons,
_b began to repeat it, _u _e voice sounded hoarse _b
strange, _b _a words did _k come _a same as they used to do:--

            `How doth _a little crocodile
              Improve his shining tail,
            And pour _a waters of _a Nile
              On every golden scale!

            `How cheerfully he seems to grin,
              How neatly spread his claws,
            And welcome little fishes in
              With gently smiling jaws!'

  `I'm sure those are _k _a right words,' _p poor _n, _b
_e eyes filled _h tears again as _d _w on, `I must be Mabel
after _1, _b I shall _g to go _b live in _f poky little
house, _b _g next to no toys to play _h, _b oh! ever _9
many lessons to learn!  No, I've made up _z mind _6 it; _5 I'm
Mabel, I'll stay _r here!  It'll be no use _4 putting _4
heads _r _b saying "Come up again, dear!"  I shall only look
up _b _c "Who am I then?  Tell me _f first, _b then, _5 I
like being _f person, I'll come up:  _5 _k, I'll stay _r
here till I'm somebody else"--_u, oh dear!' cried _n, _h a
sudden burst of tears, `I do wish they WOULD put _4 heads
_r!  I am _9 VERY tired of being _1 alone here!'

  As _d _p _q _d looked _r at _e hands, _b _l
surprised to see _f _d had put on _0 of _a Rabbit's little
white kid gloves while _d _l talking.  `How CAN I _g done
_f?' _d thought.  `I must be growing small again.'  She got up
_b _w to _a table to measure herself by it, _b found _f,
as nearly as _d could guess, _d _l now _6 two feet high,
_b _l going on shrinking rapidly:  _d soon found _8 _f _a
cause of _q _l _a fan _d _l holding, _b _d dropped it
hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.

`That WAS a narrow escape!' _p _n, a good deal frightened at
_a sudden change, _u _m glad to find herself still in
existence; `_b now _j _a garden!' _b _d ran _h _1 speed
back to _a little door:  _u, alas! _a little door _l shut
again, _b _a little golden key _l lying on _a glass table as
before, `_b things are worse than ever,' thought _a poor child,
`_j I never _l _9 small as _q before, never!  And I declare
it's too bad, _f it is!'

  As _d _p these words _e foot slipped, _b in another
moment, splash! _d _l up to _e chin in salt water.  He first
idea _l _f _d had somehow fallen into _a sea, `_b in _f
case I can go back by railway,' _d _p to herself.  (_n had
been to _a seaside once in _e life, _b had come to _a general
conclusion, _f wherever _s go to on _a English coast _s find
a number of bathing machines in _a sea, some children digging in
_a sand _h wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, _b
behind them a railway station.)  However, _d soon made _8 _f
_d _l in _a pool of tears _7 _d had wept when _d _l nine
feet high.

  `I wish I hadn't cried _9 much!' _p _n, as _d swam _6,
trying to find _e way _8.  `I shall be punished _j it now, I
suppose, by being drowned in _z own tears!  That WILL be a queer
_o, to be sure!  However, everything is queer to-day.'

  Just then _d heard something splashing _6 in _a pool a
little way off, _b _d swam nearer to make _8 _i it _l:  at
first _d thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, _u then
_d remembered _t small _d _l now, _b _d soon made _8 _f
it _l only a mouse _f had slipped in like herself.

  `Would it be of any use, now,' thought _n, `to speak to _q
mouse?  Everything is _9 _8-of-_a-way _r here, _f I should
think _m likely it can talk:  at any rate, _3's no harm in
trying.'  So _d began:  `O Mouse, do _s know _a way _8 of
_q pool?  I am _m tired of swimming _6 here, O Mouse!'
(_n thought _q must be _a right way of speaking to a mouse:
_d had never done such a _o before, _u _d remembered having
seen in _e brother's Latin Grammar, `A mouse--of a mouse--to a
mouse--a mouse--O mouse!'  The Mouse looked at _e rather
inquisitively, _b seemed to _e to wink _h _0 of its little
eyes, _u it _p nothing.

  `Perhaps it doesn't understand English,' thought _n; `I
daresay it's a French mouse, come over _h William _a
Conqueror.'  (For, _h _1 _e knowledge of history, _n had
no _m clear notion _t long ago anything had happened.)  So _d
began again:  `Ou est ma chatte?' _7 _l _a first sentence in
_e French lesson-book.  The Mouse gave a sudden leap _8 of _a
water, _b seemed to quiver _1 over _h fright.  `Oh, I beg
your pardon!' cried _n hastily, afraid _f _d had hurt _a
poor animal's feelings.  `I quite forgot _s didn't like cats.'

  `Not like cats!' cried _a Mouse, in a shrill, passionate
voice.  `Would YOU like cats _5 _s were me?'

  `Well, perhaps _k,' _p _n in a soothing tone:  `don't be
angry _6 it.  And yet I wish I could show _s our cat Dinah:
I think _s'd take a fancy to cats _5 _s could only see _e.
She is such a dear quiet _o,' _n _w on, half to herself,
as _d swam lazily _6 in _a pool, `_b _d sits purring _9
nicely by _a fire, licking _e paws _b washing _e face--_b
_d is such a nice soft _o to nurse--_b _d's such a capital
_0 _j catching mice--oh, I beg your pardon!' cried _n again,
_j _q time _a Mouse _l bristling _1 over, _b _d felt
certain it must be really offended.  `We won't talk _6 _e any
more _5 _s'd rather _k.'

  `We indeed!' cried _a Mouse, who _l trembling _r to _a end
of his tail.  `As _5 I _2 talk on such a subject!  Our family
always HATED cats:  nasty, low, vulgar things!  Don't let me hear
_a name again!'

  `I won't indeed!' _p _n, in a great hurry to change _a
subject of conversation.  `Are _s--are _s fond--of--of dogs?'
The Mouse did _k answer, _9 _n _w on eagerly:  `There is
such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show _s!
A little bright-eyed terrier, _s know, _h oh, such long curly
brown hair!  And it'll fetch things when _s throw them, _b
it'll sit up _b beg _j its dinner, _b _1 sorts of things--I
can't remember half of them--_b it belongs to a farmer, _s
know, _b he says it's _9 useful, it's worth a hundred pounds!
He says it kills _1 _a rats _b--oh dear!' cried _n in a
sorrowful tone, `I'm afraid I've offended it again!'  For _a
Mouse _l swimming away _v _e as hard as it could go, _b
making quite a commotion in _a pool as it _w.

  So _d called softly after it, `Mouse dear!  Do come back
again, _b we won't talk _6 cats or dogs either, _5 _s don't
like them!'  When _a Mouse heard _q, it turned round _b swam
slowly back to _e:  its face _l quite pale (_h passion, _n
thought), _b it _p in a low trembling voice, `Let us _x to
_a shore, _b then I'll tell _s _z history, _b _s'll
understand why it is I hate cats _b dogs.'

  It _l high time to go, _j _a pool _l getting quite crowded
_h _a birds _b animals _f had fallen into it:  _3 were a
Duck _b a Dodo, a Lory _b an Eaglet, _b several other curious
creatures.  _n led _a way, _b _a whole party swam to _a
shore.



                           CHAPTER III

                  A Caucus-Race _b a Long Tale


  They were indeed a queer-looking party _f assembled on _a
bank--_a birds _h draggled feathers, _a animals _h _4
fur clinging close to them, _b _1 dripping wet, cross, _b
uncomfortable.

  The first question of course _l, _t to _x dry again:  they
had a consultation _6 _q, _b after a few minutes it seemed
quite natural to _n to find herself talking familiarly _h
them, as _5 _d had known them _1 _e life.  Indeed, _d had
quite a long argument _h _a Lory, who at last turned sulky,
_b _2 only _c, `I am older than _s, _b must know better';
_b _q _n _2 _k allow without knowing _t old it _l,
_b, as _a Lory positively refused to tell its age, _3 _l no
more to be _p.

  At last _a Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among
them, called _8, `Sit _r, _1 of _s, _b listen to me!  I'LL
soon make _s dry enough!'  They _1 sat _r at once, in a large
ring, _h _a Mouse in _a middle.  _n kept _e eyes
anxiously fixed on it, _j _d felt sure _d _2 catch a bad
cold _5 _d did _k _x dry _m soon.

  `Ahem!' _p _a Mouse _h an important air, `are _s _1 ready?
This is _a driest _o I know.  Silence _1 round, _5 _s please!
"William _a Conqueror, whose cause _l favoured by _a pope, _l
soon submitted to by _a English, who wanted leaders, _b had been
of late much accustomed to usurpation _b conquest.  Edwin _b
Morcar, _a earls of Mercia _b Northumbria--"'

  `Ugh!' _p _a Lory, _h a shiver.

  `I beg your pardon!' _p _a Mouse, frowning, _u _m
politely:  `Did _s speak?'

  `Not I!' _p _a Lory hastily.

  `I thought _s did,' _p _a Mouse.  `--I proceed.  "Edwin _b
Morcar, _a earls of Mercia _b Northumbria, declared _j him:
_b even Stigand, _a patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found
it advisable--"'

  `Found WHAT?' _p _a Duck.

  `Found IT,' _a Mouse replied rather crossly:  `of course _s
know _i "it" means.'

  `I know _i "it" means well enough, when I find a _o,' _p
_a Duck:  `it's generally a frog or a worm.  The question is,
_i did _a archbishop find?'

  The Mouse did _k notice _q question, _u hurriedly _w on,
`"--found it advisable to go _h Edgar Atheling to meet William
_b offer him _a crown.  William's conduct at first _l
moderate.  But _a insolence of his Normans--"  How are _s
getting on now, _z dear?' it continued, turning to _n as it
spoke.

  `As wet as ever,' _p _n in a melancholy tone:  `it doesn't
seem to dry me at _1.'

  `In _f case,' _p _a Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, `I
move _f _a meeting adjourn, _j _a immediate adoption of more
energetic remedies--'

  `Speak English!' _p _a Eaglet.  `I don't know _a meaning of
half those long words, _b, _i's more, I don't believe _s do
either!'  And _a Eaglet bent _r its head to hide a smile:
some of _a other birds tittered audibly.

  `What I _l going to _c,' _p _a Dodo in an offended tone,
`_l, _f _a best _o to _x us dry _2 be a Caucus-race.'

  `What IS a Caucus-race?' _p _n; _k _f _d wanted much
to know, _u _a Dodo had paused as _5 it thought _f SOMEBODY
ought to speak, _b no _0 else seemed inclined to _c anything.

  `Why,' _p _a Dodo, `_a best way to explain it is to do it.'
(And, as _s might like to try _a _o yourself, some winter
day, I _y tell _s _t _a Dodo managed it.)

  First it marked _8 a race-course, in a sort of circle, (`_a
exact shape doesn't matter,' it _p,) _b then _1 _a party
were placed along _a course, here _b _3.  There _l no `One,
two, three, _b away,' _u they began running when they liked,
_b left off when they liked, _9 _f it _l _k easy to know
when _a race _l over.  However, when they had been running half
an hour or _9, _b were quite dry again, _a Dodo suddenly called
_8 `The race is over!' _b they _1 crowded round it, panting,
_b asking, `But who has won?'

  This question _a Dodo could _k answer without a great deal of
thought, _b it sat _j a long time _h _0 finger pressed upon
its forehead (_a position in _7 _s usually see Shakespeare,
in _a pictures of him), while _a rest waited in silence.  At
last _a Dodo _p, `EVERYBODY has won, _b _1 must _g
prizes.'

  `But who is to give _a prizes?' quite a chorus of voices
asked.

  `Why, SHE, of course,' _p _a Dodo, pointing to _n _h
_0 finger; _b _a whole party at once crowded round _e,
calling _8 in a confused way, `Prizes! Prizes!'

  _n had no idea _i to do, _b in despair _d put _e hand
in _e pocket, _b pulled _8 a box of comfits, (luckily _a salt
water had _k got into it), _b handed them round as prizes.
There _l exactly _0 a-piece _1 round.

  `But _d must _g a prize herself, _s know,' _p _a Mouse.

  `Of course,' _a Dodo replied _m gravely.  `What else _g
_s got in your pocket?' he _w on, turning to _n.

  `Only a thimble,' _p _n sadly.

  `Hand it over here,' _p _a Dodo.

  Then they _1 crowded round _e once more, while _a Dodo
solemnly presented _a thimble, saying `We beg your acceptance of
_q elegant thimble'; _b, when it had finished _q short
speech, they _1 cheered.

  _n thought _a whole _o _m absurd, _u they _1 looked
_9 grave _f _d did _k dare to laugh; _b, as _d could _k
think of anything to _c, _d simply bowed, _b took _a thimble,
looking as solemn as _d could.

  The next _o _l to eat _a comfits:  _q caused some noise
_b confusion, as _a large birds complained _f they could _k
taste theirs, _b _a small ones choked _b had to be patted on
_a back.  However, it _l over at last, _b they sat _r again
in a ring, _b begged _a Mouse to tell them something more.

  `You promised to tell me your history, _s know,' _p _n,
`_b why it is _s hate--C _b D,' _d added in a whisper, half
afraid _f it _2 be offended again.

  `Mine is a long _b a sad tale!' _p _a Mouse, turning to
_n, _b sighing.

  `It IS a long tail, certainly,' _p _n, looking _r _h
wonder at _a Mouse's tail; `_u why do _s call it sad?'  And
_d kept on puzzling _6 it while _a Mouse _l speaking, _9
_f _e idea of _a tale _l something like _q:--

                    `Fury _p to a
                   mouse, That he
                 met in _a
               house,
            "Let us
              both go to
                law:  I _y
                  prosecute
                    YOU.  --Come,
                       I'll take no
                        denial; We
                     must _g a
                 trial:  For
              really _q
           morning I've
          nothing
         to do."
           Said _a
             mouse to _a
               cur, "Such
                 a trial,
                   dear Sir,
                         With
                     no jury
                  or judge,
                _2 be
              wasting
             our
              breath."
               "I'll be
                 judge, I'll
                   be jury,"
                         Said
                    cunning
                      old Fury:
                     "I'll
                      try _a
                         whole

                             _b
                        condemn
                       _s
                      to
                       death."'


  `You are _k attending!' _p _a Mouse to _n severely.
`What are _s thinking of?'

  `I beg your pardon,' _p _n _m humbly:  `_s had got to
_a fifth bend, I think?'

  `I had NOT!' cried _a Mouse, sharply _b _m angrily.

  `A knot!' _p _n, always ready to make herself useful, _b
looking anxiously _6 _e.  `Oh, do let me help to undo it!'

  `I shall do nothing of _a sort,' _p _a Mouse, getting up
_b walking away.  `You insult me by talking such nonsense!'

  `I didn't mean it!' pleaded poor _n.  `But _s're _9 easily
offended, _s know!'

  The Mouse only growled in reply.

  `Please come back _b finish your story!' _n called after
it; _b _a others _1 joined in chorus, `Yes, please do!' _u
_a Mouse only shook its head impatiently, _b walked a little
quicker.

  `What a pity it wouldn't stay!' sighed _a Lory, as soon as it
_l quite _8 of sight; _b an old Crab took _a opportunity of
saying to _e daughter `Ah, _z dear!  Let _q be a lesson to _s
never to lose YOUR temper!'  `Hold your tongue, Ma!' _p _a
young Crab, a little snappishly.  `You're enough to try _a
patience of an oyster!'

  `I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!' _p _n aloud,
addressing nobody in particular.  `She'd soon fetch it back!'

  `And who is Dinah, _5 I might venture to ask _a question?'
_p _a Lory.

  _n replied eagerly, _j _d _l always ready to talk _6
_e pet:  `Dinah's our cat.  And _d's such a capital _0 _j
catching mice _s can't think!  And oh, I wish _s could see _e
after _a birds!  Why, _d'll eat a little bird as soon as look
at it!'

  This speech caused a remarkable sensation among _a party.
Some of _a birds hurried off at once:  _0 _a old Magpie began
wrapping itself up _m carefully, remarking, `I really must be
getting home; _a night-air doesn't suit _z throat!' _b a Canary
called _8 in a trembling voice to its children, `Come away, _z
dears!  It's high time _s were _1 in bed!'  On various pretexts
they _1 moved off, _b _n _l soon left alone.

  `I wish I hadn't mentioned Dinah!' _d _p to herself in a
melancholy tone.  `Nobody seems to like _e, _r here, _b I'm
sure _d's _a best cat in _a world!  Oh, _z dear Dinah!  I
wonder _5 I shall ever see _s any more!'  And here poor _n
began to cry again, _j _d felt _m lonely _b low-spirited.
In a little while, however, _d again heard a little pattering of
footsteps in _a distance, _b _d looked up eagerly, half hoping
_f _a Mouse had changed his mind, _b _l coming back to
finish his story.



                           CHAPTER IV

                The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill


  It _l _a White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, _b
looking anxiously _6 as it _w, as _5 it had lost something;
_b _d heard it muttering to itself `The Duchess!  The Duchess!
Oh _z dear paws!  Oh _z fur _b whiskers!  She'll _x me
executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets!  Where CAN I _g
dropped them, I wonder?'  _n guessed in a moment _f it _l
looking _j _a fan _b _a pair of white kid gloves, _b _d
_m good-naturedly began hunting _6 _j them, _u they were
nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to _g changed since _e
swim in _a pool, _b _a great hall, _h _a glass table _b
_a little door, had vanished completely.

  Very soon _a Rabbit noticed _n, as _d _w hunting _6,
_b called _8 to _e in an angry tone, `Why, Mary Ann, _i ARE
_s doing _8 here?  Run home _q moment, _b fetch me a pair of
gloves _b a fan!  Quick, now!'  And _n _l _9 much frightened
_f _d ran off at once in _a direction it pointed to, without
trying to explain _a mistake it had made.

  `He took me _j his housemaid,' _d _p to herself as _d ran.
`How surprised he'll be when he finds _8 who I am!  But I'd
better take him his fan _b gloves--_f is, _5 I can find them.'
As _d _p _q, _d came upon a neat little house, on _a door
of _7 _l a bright brass plate _h _a name `W. RABBIT'
engraved upon it.  She _w in without knocking, _b hurried
upstairs, in great fear lest _d should meet _a real Mary Ann,
_b be turned _8 of _a house before _d had found _a fan _b
gloves.

  `How queer it seems,' _n _p to herself, `to be going
messages _j a rabbit!  I suppose Dinah'll be sending me on
messages next!'  And _d began fancying _a sort of _o _f
_2 happen:  `"Miss _n!  Come here directly, _b _x ready
_j your walk!" "Coming in a minute, nurse!  But I've got to see
_f _a mouse doesn't _x _8."  Only I don't think,' _n _w
on, `_f they'd let Dinah stop in _a house _5 it began ordering
people _6 like _f!'

  By _q time _d had found _e way into a tidy little room _h
a table in _a window, _b on it (as _d had hoped) a fan _b two
or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves:  _d took up _a fan _b
a pair of _a gloves, _b _l just going to leave _a room, when
_e eye fell upon a little bottle _f stood near _a looking-
glass.  There _l no label _q time _h _a words `DRINK ME,'
_u nevertheless _d uncorked it _b put it to _e lips.  `I know
SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen,' _d _p to herself,
`whenever I eat or drink anything; _9 I'll just see _i _q
bottle does.  I do hope it'll make me grow large again, _j
really I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little _o!'

  It did _9 indeed, _b much sooner than _d had expected:
before _d had drunk half _a bottle, _d found _e head pressing
against _a ceiling, _b had to stoop to save _e neck _v being
broken.  She hastily put _r _a bottle, saying to herself
`That's quite enough--I hope I shan't grow any more--As it is, I
can't _x _8 at _a door--I do wish I hadn't drunk quite _9
much!'

  Alas! it _l too late to wish _f!  She _w on growing, _b
growing, _b _m soon had to kneel _r on _a floor:  in
another minute _3 _l _k even room _j _q, _b _d tried
_a effect of lying _r _h _0 elbow against _a door, _b _a
other arm curled round _e head.  Still _d _w on growing, _b,
as a last resource, _d put _0 arm _8 of _a window, _b _0
foot up _a chimney, _b _p to herself `Now I can do no more,
whatever happens.  What WILL become of me?'

  Luckily _j _n, _a little magic bottle had now had its full
effect, _b _d grew no larger:  still it _l _m uncomfortable,
_b, as _3 seemed to be no sort of chance of _e ever getting
_8 of _a room again, no wonder _d felt unhappy.

  `It _l much pleasanter at home,' thought poor _n, `when _0
wasn't always growing larger _b smaller, _b being ordered _6
by mice _b rabbits.  I almost wish I hadn't gone _r _f
rabbit-hole--_b yet--_b yet--it's rather curious, _s know,
_q sort of life!  I do wonder _i CAN _g happened to me!
When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied _f kind of _o
never happened, _b now here I am in _a middle of _0!  There
ought to be a book written _6 me, _f _3 ought!  And when
I grow up, I'll write _0--_u I'm grown up now,' _d added in a
sorrowful tone; `at least _3's no room to grow up any more
HERE.'

  `But then,' thought _n, `shall I NEVER _x any older than I
am now?  That'll be a comfort, _0 way--never to be an old woman-
-_u then--always to _g lessons to learn!  Oh, I shouldn't like
THAT!'

  `Oh, _s foolish _n!' _d answered herself.  `How can _s
learn lessons in here?  Why, _3's hardly room _j YOU, _b no
room at _1 _j any lesson-books!'

  And _9 _d _w on, taking first _0 side _b then _a other,
_b making quite a conversation of it altogether; _u after a few
minutes _d heard a voice outside, _b stopped to listen.

  `Mary Ann!  Mary Ann!' _p _a voice.  `Fetch me _z gloves
_q moment!'  Then came a little pattering of feet on _a
stairs.  _n knew it _l _a Rabbit coming to look _j _e, _b
_d trembled till _d shook _a house, quite forgetting _f _d
_l now _6 a thousand times as large as _a Rabbit, _b had no
reason to be afraid of it.

  Presently _a Rabbit came up to _a door, _b tried to open it;
_u, as _a door opened inwards, _b _n's elbow _l pressed
hard against it, _f attempt proved a failure.  _n heard it
_c to itself `Then I'll go round _b _x in at _a window.'

  `THAT _s won't' thought _n, _b, after waiting till _d
fancied _d heard _a Rabbit just under _a window, _d suddenly
spread _8 _e hand, _b made a snatch in _a air.  She did _k
_x hold of anything, _u _d heard a little shriek _b a fall,
_b a crash of broken glass, _v _7 _d concluded _f it _l
just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something
of _a sort.

  Next came an angry voice--_a Rabbit's--`Pat! Pat!  Where are
_s?'  And then a voice _d had never heard before, `Sure then
I'm here!  Digging _j apples, yer honour!'

  `Digging _j apples, indeed!' _p _a Rabbit angrily.  `Here!
Come _b help me _8 of THIS!'  (Sounds of more broken glass.)

  `Now tell me, Pat, _i's _f in _a window?'

  `Sure, it's an arm, yer honour!'  (He pronounced it `arrum.')

  `An arm, _s goose!   Who ever saw _0 _f size?  Why, it
fills _a whole window!'

  `Sure, it does, yer honour:  _u it's an arm _j _1 _f.'

  `Well, it's got no business _3, at any rate:  go _b take it
away!'

  There _l a long silence after _q, _b _n could only hear
whispers now _b then; such as, `Sure, I don't like it, yer
honour, at _1, at _1!'  `Do as I tell _s, _s coward!' _b at
last _d spread _8 _e hand again, _b made another snatch in
_a air.  This time _3 were TWO little shrieks, _b more
sounds of broken glass.  `What a number of cucumber-frames _3
must be!' thought _n.  `I wonder _i they'll do next!  As _j
pulling me _8 of _a window, I only wish they COULD!  I'm sure I
don't want to stay in here any longer!'

  She waited _j some time without hearing anything more:  at
last came a rumbling of little cartwheels, _b _a sound of a
good many voice _1 talking together:  _d made _8 _a words:
`Where's _a other ladder?--Why, I hadn't to bring _u _0;
Bill's got _a other--Bill! fetch it here, lad!--Here, put 'em up
at _q corner--No, tie 'em together first--they don't reach half
high enough yet--Oh! they'll do well enough; don't be particular-
-Here, Bill! catch hold of _q rope--Will _a roof bear?--Mind
_f loose slate--Oh, it's coming _r!  Heads below!' (a loud
crash)--`Now, who did _f?--It _l Bill, I fancy--Who's to go
_r _a chimney?--Nay, I shan't! YOU do it!--That I won't,
then!--Bill's to go _r--Here, Bill! _a master says _s're to
go _r _a chimney!'

  `Oh! So Bill's got to come _r _a chimney, has he?' _p
_n to herself.  `Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill!
I wouldn't be in Bill's place _j a good deal:  _q fireplace is
narrow, to be sure; _u I THINK I can kick a little!'

  She drew _e foot as far _r _a chimney as _d could, _b
waited till _d heard a little animal (_d couldn't guess of _i
sort it _l) scratching _b scrambling _6 in _a chimney close
above _e:  then, saying to herself `This is Bill,' _d gave _0
sharp kick, _b waited to see _i _2 happen next.

  The first _o _d heard _l a general chorus of `There goes
Bill!' then _a Rabbit's voice along--`Catch him, _s by _a
hedge!' then silence, _b then another confusion of voices--`Hold
up his head--Brandy now--Don't choke him--How _l it, old fellow?
What happened to _s?  Tell us _1 _6 it!'

  Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (`That's Bill,'
thought _n,) `Well, I hardly know--No more, thank ye; I'm
better now--_u I'm a deal too flustered to tell _s--_1 I know
is, something comes at me like a Jack-in-_a-box, _b up I goes
like a sky-rocket!'

  `So _s did, old fellow!' _p _a others.

  `We must burn _a house _r!' _p _a Rabbit's voice; _b
_n called _8 as loud as _d could, `If _s do.  I'll set
Dinah at _s!'

  There _l a dead silence instantly, _b _n thought to
herself, `I wonder _i they WILL do next!  If they had any
sense, they'd take _a roof off.'  After a minute or two, they
began moving _6 again, _b _n heard _a Rabbit _c, `A
barrowful _y do, to begin _h.'

  `A barrowful of WHAT?' thought _n; _u _d had _k long to
doubt, _j _a next moment a shower of little pebbles came
rattling in at _a window, _b some of them hit _e in _a face.
`I'll put a stop to _q,' _d _p to herself, _b shouted _8,
`You'd better _k do _f again!' _7 produced another dead
silence.

  _n noticed _h some surprise _f _a pebbles were _1
turning into little cakes as they lay on _a floor, _b a bright
idea came into _e head.  `If I eat _0 of these cakes,' _d
thought, `it's sure to make SOME change in _z size; _b as it
can't possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller, I
suppose.'

  So _d swallowed _0 of _a cakes, _b _l delighted to find
_f _d began shrinking directly.  As soon as _d _l small
enough to _x through _a door, _d ran _8 of _a house, _b
found quite a crowd of little animals _b birds waiting outside.
The poor little Lizard, Bill, _l in _a middle, being held up by
two guinea-pigs, who were giving it something _8 of a bottle.
They _1 made a rush at _n _a moment _d appeared; _u _d
ran off as hard as _d could, _b soon found herself safe in a
thick wood.

  `The first _o I've got to do,' _p _n to herself, as _d
wandered _6 in _a wood, `is to grow to _z right size again;
_b _a second _o is to find _z way into _f lovely garden.
I think _f _y be _a best plan.'

  It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, _b _m neatly _b
simply arranged; _a only difficulty _l, _f _d had _k _a
smallest idea _t to set _6 it; _b while _d _l peering
_6 anxiously among _a trees, a little sharp bark just over
_e head made _e look up in a great hurry.

  An enormous puppy _l looking _r at _e _h large round
eyes, _b feebly stretching _8 _0 paw, trying to touch _e.
`Poor little _o!' _p _n, in a coaxing tone, _b _d tried
hard to whistle to it; _u _d _l terribly frightened _1 _a
time at _a thought _f it might be hungry, in _7 case it
_2 be _m likely to eat _e up in spite of _1 _e coaxing.

  Hardly knowing _i _d did, _d picked up a little bit of
stick, _b held it _8 to _a puppy; whereupon _a puppy jumped
into _a air off _1 its feet at once, _h a yelp of delight,
_b rushed at _a stick, _b made believe to worry it; then _n
dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself _v being run
over; _b _a moment _d appeared on _a other side, _a puppy
made another rush at _a stick, _b tumbled head over heels in
its hurry to _x hold of it; then _n, thinking it _l _m
like having a game of play _h a cart-horse, _b expecting every
moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round _a thistle
again; then _a puppy began a series of short charges at _a
stick, running a _m little way forwards each time _b a long
way back, _b barking hoarsely _1 _a while, till at last it sat
_r a good way off, panting, _h its tongue hanging _8 of its
mouth, _b its great eyes half shut.

  This seemed to _n a good opportunity _j making _e escape;
_9 _d set off at once, _b ran till _d _l quite tired _b _8
of breath, _b till _a puppy's bark sounded quite faint in _a
distance.

  `And yet _i a dear little puppy it _l!' _p _n, as _d
leant against a buttercup to rest herself, _b fanned herself
_h _0 of _a leaves:  `I should _g liked teaching it tricks
_m much, _5--_5 I'd only been _a right size to do it!  Oh
dear!  I'd nearly forgotten _f I've got to grow up again!  Let
me see--_t IS it to be managed?  I suppose I ought to eat or
drink something or other; _u _a great question is, _i?'

  The great question certainly _l, _i?  _n looked _1 round
_e at _a flowers _b _a blades of grass, _u _d did _k see
anything _f looked like _a right _o to eat or drink under
_a circumstances.  There _l a large mushroom growing near _e,
_6 _a same height as herself; _b when _d had looked under
it, _b on both sides of it, _b behind it, it occurred to _e
_f _d might as well look _b see _i _l on _a top of it.

  She stretched herself up on tiptoe, _b peeped over _a edge of
_a mushroom, _b _e eyes immediately met those of a large
caterpillar, _f _l sitting on _a top _h its arms folded,
quietly smoking a long hookah, _b taking _k _a smallest notice
of _e or of anything else.



                            CHAPTER V

                    Advice _v a Caterpillar


  The Caterpillar _b _n looked at each other _j some time in
silence:  at last _a Caterpillar took _a hookah _8 of its
mouth, _b addressed _e in a languid, sleepy voice.

  `Who are YOU?' _p _a Caterpillar.

  This _l _k an encouraging opening _j a conversation.  _n
replied, rather shyly, `I--I hardly know, sir, just at present--
at least I know who I WAS when I got up _q morning, _u I think
I must _g been changed several times since then.'

  `What do _s mean by _f?' _p _a Caterpillar sternly.
`Explain yourself!'

  `I can't explain MYSELF, I'm afraid, sir' _p _n, `because
I'm _k myself, _s see.'

  `I don't see,' _p _a Caterpillar.

  `I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly,' _n replied _m
politely, `_j I can't understand it myself to begin _h; _b
being _9 many different sizes in a day is _m confusing.'

  `It isn't,' _p _a Caterpillar.

  `Well, perhaps _s haven't found it _9 yet,' _p _n; `_u
when _s _g to turn into a chrysalis--_s _y some day, _s
know--_b then after _f into a butterfly, I should think _s'll
feel it a little queer, won't _s?'

  `Not a bit,' _p _a Caterpillar.

  `Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,' _p _n;
`_1 I know is, it _2 feel _m queer to ME.'

  `You!' _p _a Caterpillar contemptuously.  `Who are YOU?'

  Which brought them back again to _a beginning of _a
conversation.  _n felt a little irritated at _a Caterpillar's
making such VERY short remarks, _b _d drew herself up _b _p,
_m gravely, `I think, _s ought to tell me who YOU are, first.'

  `Why?' _p _a Caterpillar.

  Here _l another puzzling question; _b as _n could _k
think of any good reason, _b as _a Caterpillar seemed to be in
a VERY unpleasant state of mind, _d turned away.

  `Come back!' _a Caterpillar called after _e.  `I've something
important to _c!'

  This sounded promising, certainly:  _n turned _b came back
again.

  `Keep your temper,' _p _a Caterpillar.

  `Is _f _1?' _p _n, swallowing _r _e anger as well as
_d could.

  `No,' _p _a Caterpillar.

  _n thought _d might as well wait, as _d had nothing else
to do, _b perhaps after _1 it might tell _e something worth
hearing.  For some minutes it puffed away without speaking, _u
at last it unfolded its arms, took _a hookah _8 of its mouth
again, _b _p, `So _s think _s're changed, do _s?'

  `I'm afraid I am, sir,' _p _n; `I can't remember things as
I used--_b I don't keep _a same size _j ten minutes together!'

  `Can't remember WHAT things?' _p _a Caterpillar.

  `Well, I've tried to _c "HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE," _u it
_1 came different!' _n replied in a _m melancholy voice.

  `Repeat, "YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,"' _p _a Caterpillar.

  _n folded _e hands, _b began:--

    `You are old, Father William,' _a young man _p,
      `And your hair has become _m white;
    And yet _s incessantly stand on your head--
      Do _s think, at your age, it is right?'

    `In _z youth,' Father William replied to his son,
      `I feared it might injure _a brain;
    But, now _f I'm perfectly sure I _g none,
      Why, I do it again _b again.'

    `You are old,' _p _a youth, `as I mentioned before,
      And _g grown most uncommonly fat;
    Yet _s turned a back-somersault in at _a door--
      Pray, _i is _a reason of _f?'

    `In _z youth,' _p _a sage, as he shook his grey locks,
      `I kept _1 _z limbs _m supple
    By _a use of _q ointment--_0 shilling _a box--
      Allow me to sell _s a couple?'

    `You are old,' _p _a youth, `_b your jaws are too weak
      For anything tougher than suet;
    Yet _s finished _a goose, _h _a bones _b _a beak--
      Pray _t did _s manage to do it?'

    `In _z youth,' _p his father, `I took to _a law,
      And argued each case _h _z wife;
    And _a muscular strength, _7 it gave to _z jaw,
      Has lasted _a rest of _z life.'

    `You are old,' _p _a youth, `_0 _2 hardly suppose
      That your eye _l as steady as ever;
    Yet _s balanced an eel on _a end of your nose--
      What made _s _9 awfully clever?'

    `I _g answered three questions, _b _f is enough,'
      Said his father; `don't give yourself airs!
    Do _s think I can listen _1 day to such stuff?
      Be off, or I'll kick _s _r stairs!'


  `That is _k _p right,' _p _a Caterpillar.

  `Not QUITE right, I'm afraid,' _p _n, timidly; `some of _a
words _g got altered.'

  `It is wrong _v beginning to end,' _p _a Caterpillar
decidedly, _b _3 _l silence _j some minutes.

  The Caterpillar _l _a first to speak.

  `What size do _s want to be?' it asked.

  `Oh, I'm _k particular as to size,' _n hastily replied;
`only _0 doesn't like changing _9 often, _s know.'

  `I DON'T know,' _p _a Caterpillar.

  _n _p nothing:  _d had never been _9 much contradicted in
_e life before, _b _d felt _f _d _l losing _e temper.

  `Are _s content now?' _p _a Caterpillar.

  `Well, I should like to be a LITTLE larger, sir, _5 _s
wouldn't mind,' _p _n:  `three inches is such a wretched
height to be.'

  `It is a _m good height indeed!' _p _a Caterpillar
angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it _l exactly three
inches high).

  `But I'm _k used to it!' pleaded poor _n in a piteous tone.
And _d thought of herself, `I wish _a creatures wouldn't be _9
easily offended!'

  `You'll _x used to it in time,' _p _a Caterpillar; _b it
put _a hookah into its mouth _b began smoking again.

  This time _n waited patiently until it chose to speak again.
In a minute or two _a Caterpillar took _a hookah _8 of its
mouth _b yawned once or twice, _b shook itself.  Then it got
_r off _a mushroom, _b crawled away in _a grass, merely
remarking as it _w, `One side _y make _s grow taller, _b
_a other side _y make _s grow shorter.'

  `One side of WHAT?  The other side of WHAT?' thought _n to
herself.

  `Of _a mushroom,' _p _a Caterpillar, just as _5 _d had
asked it aloud; _b in another moment it _l _8 of sight.

  _n remained looking thoughtfully at _a mushroom _j a
minute, trying to make _8 _7 were _a two sides of it; _b as
it _l perfectly round, _d found _q a _m difficult question.
However, at last _d stretched _e arms round it as far as they
_2 go, _b broke off a bit of _a edge _h each hand.

  `And now _7 is _7?' _d _p to herself, _b nibbled a
little of _a right-hand bit to try _a effect:  _a next moment
_d felt a violent blow underneath _e chin:  it had struck _e
foot!

  She _l a good deal frightened by _q _m sudden change, _u
_d felt _f _3 _l no time to be lost, as _d _l shrinking
rapidly; _9 _d set to work at once to eat some of _a other bit.
Her chin _l pressed _9 closely against _e foot, _f _3 _l
hardly room to open _e mouth; _u _d did it at last, _b
managed to swallow a morsel of _a lefthand bit.


     *       *       *       *       *       *       *

         *       *       *       *       *       *

     *       *       *       *       *       *       *

  `Come, _z head's free at last!' _p _n in a tone of
delight, _7 changed into alarm in another moment, when _d
found _f _e shoulders were nowhere to be found:  _1 _d could
see, when _d looked _r, _l an immense length of neck, _7
seemed to rise like a stalk _8 of a sea of green leaves _f lay
far below _e.

  `What CAN _1 _f green stuff be?' _p _n.  `And where
HAVE _z shoulders got to?  And oh, _z poor hands, _t is it I
can't see _s?'  She _l moving them _6 as _d spoke, _u no
result seemed to follow, except a little shaking among _a
distant green leaves.

  As _3 seemed to be no chance of getting _e hands up to _e
head, _d tried to _x _e head _r to them, _b _l delighted
to find _f _e neck _2 bend _6 easily in any direction,
like a serpent.  She had just succeeded in curving it _r into a
graceful zigzag, _b _l going to dive in among _a leaves, _7
_d found to be nothing _u _a tops of _a trees under _7 _d
had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made _e draw back in a
hurry:  a large pigeon had flown into _e face, _b _l beating
_e violently _h its wings.

  `Serpent!' screamed _a Pigeon.

  `I'm NOT a serpent!' _p _n indignantly.  `Let me alone!'

  `Serpent, I _c again!' repeated _a Pigeon, _u in a more
subdued tone, _b added _h a kind of sob, `I've tried every
way, _b nothing seems to suit them!'

  `I haven't _a least idea _i _s're talking _6,' _p
_n.

  `I've tried _a roots of trees, _b I've tried banks, _b I've
tried hedges,' _a Pigeon _w on, without attending to _e; `_u
those serpents!  There's no pleasing them!'

  _n _l more _b more puzzled, _u _d thought _3 _l no
use in saying anything more till _a Pigeon had finished.

  `As _5 it wasn't trouble enough hatching _a eggs,' _p _a
Pigeon; `_u I must be on _a look-_8 _j serpents night _b
day!  Why, I haven't had a wink of sleep these three weeks!'

  `I'm _m sorry _s've been annoyed,' _p _n, who _l
beginning to see its meaning.

  `And just as I'd taken _a highest tree in _a wood,' continued
_a Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, `_b just as I _l
thinking I should be free of them at last, they must needs come
wriggling _r _v _a sky!  Ugh, Serpent!'

  `But I'm NOT a serpent, I tell _s!' _p _n.  `I'm a--I'm
a--'

  `Well!  WHAT are _s?' _p _a Pigeon.  `I can see _s're
trying to invent something!'

  `I--I'm a little girl,' _p _n, rather doubtfully, as _d
remembered _a number of changes _d had gone through _f day.

  `A likely story indeed!' _p _a Pigeon in a tone of _a
deepest contempt.  `I've seen a good many little girls in _z
time, _u never ONE _h such a neck as _f!  No, no!  You're a
serpent; _b _3's no use denying it.  I suppose _s'll be
telling me next _f _s never tasted an egg!'

  `I HAVE tasted eggs, certainly,' _p _n, who _l a _m
truthful child; `_u little girls eat eggs quite as much as
serpents do, _s know.'

  `I don't believe it,' _p _a Pigeon; `_u _5 they do, why
then they're a kind of serpent, _f's _1 I can _c.'

  This _l such a new idea to _n, _f _d _l quite silent
_j a minute or two, _7 gave _a Pigeon _a opportunity of
adding, `You're looking _j eggs, I know THAT well enough; _b
_i does it matter to me whether _s're a little girl or a
serpent?'

  `It matters a good deal to ME,' _p _n hastily; `_u I'm
_k looking _j eggs, as it happens; _b _5 I _l, I shouldn't
want YOURS:  I don't like them raw.'

  `Well, be off, then!' _p _a Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it
settled _r again into its nest.  _n crouched _r among _a
trees as well as _d could, _j _e neck kept getting entangled
among _a branches, _b every now _b then _d had to stop _b
untwist it.  After a while _d remembered _f _d still held _a
pieces of mushroom in _e hands, _b _d set to work _m
carefully, nibbling first at _0 _b then at _a other, _b
growing sometimes taller _b sometimes shorter, until _d had
succeeded in bringing herself _r to _e usual height.

  It _l _9 long since _d had been anything near _a right size,
_f it felt quite strange at first; _u _d got used to it in a
few minutes, _b began talking to herself, as usual.  `Come,
_3's half _z plan done now!  How puzzling _1 these changes
are!  I'm never sure _i I'm going to be, _v _0 minute to
another!  However, I've got back to _z right size:  _a next
_o is, to _x into _f beautiful garden--_t IS _f to be
done, I wonder?'  As _d _p _q, _d came suddenly upon an
open place, _h a little house in it _6 four feet high.
`Whoever lives _3,' thought _n, `it'll never do to come
upon them THIS size:  why, I should frighten them _8 of _4
wits!'  So _d began nibbling at _a righthand bit again, _b did
_k venture to go near _a house till _d had brought herself
_r to nine inches high.



                           CHAPTER VI

                         Pig _b Pepper


  For a minute or two _d stood looking at _a house, _b
wondering _i to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came
running _8 of _a wood--(_d considered him to be a footman
because he _l in livery:  otherwise, judging by his face only,
_d _2 _g called him a fish)--_b rapped loudly at _a door
_h his knuckles.  It _l opened by another footman in livery,
_h a round face, _b large eyes like a frog; _b both footmen,
_n noticed, had powdered hair _f curled _1 over _4
heads.  She felt _m curious to know _i it _l _1 _6, _b
crept a little way _8 of _a wood to listen.

  The Fish-Footman began by producing _v under his arm a great
letter, nearly as large as himself, _b _q he handed over to
_a other, saying, in a solemn tone, `For _a Duchess.  An
invitation _v _a Queen to play croquet.'  The Frog-Footman
repeated, in _a same solemn tone, only changing _a order of _a
words a little, `From _a Queen.  An invitation _j _a Duchess
to play croquet.'

  Then they both bowed low, _b _4 curls got entangled
together.

  _n laughed _9 much at _q, _f _d had to run back into
_a wood _j fear of _4 hearing _e; _b when _d next peeped
_8 _a Fish-Footman _l gone, _b _a other _l sitting on _a
ground near _a door, staring stupidly up into _a sky.

  _n _w timidly up to _a door, _b knocked.

  `There's no sort of use in knocking,' _p _a Footman, `_b
_f _j two reasons.  First, because I'm on _a same side of _a
door as _s are; secondly, because they're making such a noise
inside, no _0 could possibly hear _s.'  And certainly _3 _l
a most extraordinary noise going on within--a constant howling
_b sneezing, _b every now _b then a great crash, as _5 a dish
or kettle had been broken to pieces.

  `Please, then,' _p _n, `_t am I to _x in?'

  `There might be some sense in your knocking,' _a Footman _w
on without attending to _e, `_5 we had _a door between us.  For
instance, _5 _s were INSIDE, _s might knock, _b I could let
_s _8, _s know.'  He _l looking up into _a sky _1 _a time
he _l speaking, _b _q _n thought decidedly uncivil.  `But
perhaps he can't help it,' _d _p to herself; `his eyes are _9
VERY nearly at _a top of his head.  But at any rate he might
answer questions.--How am I to _x in?' _d repeated, aloud.

  `I shall sit here,' _a Footman remarked, `till tomorrow--'

  At _q moment _a door of _a house opened, _b a large plate
came skimming _8, straight at _a Footman's head:  it just
grazed his nose, _b broke to pieces against _0 of _a trees
behind him.

  `--or next day, maybe,' _a Footman continued in _a same tone,
exactly as _5 nothing had happened.

  `How am I to _x in?' asked _n again, in a louder tone.

  `ARE _s to _x in at _1?' _p _a Footman.  `That's _a
first question, _s know.'

  It _l, no doubt:  only _n did _k like to be told _9.
`It's really dreadful,' _d muttered to herself, `_a way _1 _a
creatures argue.  It's enough to drive _0 crazy!'

  The Footman seemed to think _q a good opportunity _j
repeating his remark, _h variations.  `I shall sit here,' he
_p, `on _b off, _j days _b days.'

  `But _i am I to do?' _p _n.

  `Anything _s like,' _p _a Footman, _b began whistling.

  `Oh, _3's no use in talking to him,' _p _n desperately:
`he's perfectly idiotic!'  And _d opened _a door _b _w in.

  The door led right into a large kitchen, _7 _l full of
smoke _v _0 end to _a other:  _a Duchess _l sitting on a
three-legged stool in _a middle, nursing a baby; _a cook _l
leaning over _a fire, stirring a large cauldron _7 seemed to
be full of soup.

  `There's certainly too much pepper in _f soup!' _n _p to
herself, as well as _d could _j sneezing.

  There _l certainly too much of it in _a air.  Even _a
Duchess sneezed occasionally; _b as _j _a baby, it _l
sneezing _b howling alternately without a moment's pause.  The
only things in _a kitchen _f did _k sneeze, were _a cook,
_b a large cat _7 _l sitting on _a hearth _b grinning _v
ear to ear.

  `Please _2 _s tell me,' _p _n, a little timidly, _j
_d _l _k quite sure whether it _l good manners _j _e to
speak first, `why your cat grins like _f?'

  `It's a Cheshire cat,' _p _a Duchess, `_b _f's why.
Pig!'

  She _p _a last word _h such sudden violence _f _n
quite jumped; _u _d saw in another moment _f it _l addressed
to _a baby, _b _k to _e, _9 _d took courage, _b _w on
again:--

  `I didn't know _f Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I
didn't know _f cats COULD grin.'

  `They _1 can,' _p _a Duchess; `_b most of 'em do.'

  `I don't know of any _f do,' _n _p _m politely,
feeling quite pleased to _g got into a conversation.

  `You don't know much,' _p _a Duchess; `_b _f's a fact.'

  _n did _k at _1 like _a tone of _q remark, _b thought
it _2 be as well to introduce some other subject of
conversation.  While _d _l trying to fix on _0, _a cook took
_a cauldron of soup off _a fire, _b at once set to work
throwing everything within _e reach at _a Duchess _b _a baby
--_a fire-irons came first; then followed a shower of saucepans,
plates, _b dishes.  The Duchess took no notice of them even when
they hit _e; _b _a baby _l howling _9 much already, _f it
_l quite impossible to _c whether _a blows hurt it or _k.

  `Oh, PLEASE mind _i _s're doing!' cried _n, jumping up
_b _r in an agony of terror.  `Oh, _3 goes his PRECIOUS
nose'; as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it, _b _m
nearly carried it off.

  `If everybody minded _4 own business,' _a Duchess _p in a
hoarse growl, `_a world _2 go round a deal faster than it
does.'

  `Which _2 NOT be an advantage,' _p _n, who felt _m
glad to _x an opportunity of showing off a little of _e
knowledge.  `Just think of _i work it _2 make _h _a day
_b night!  You see _a earth takes twenty-four hours to turn
round on its axis--'

  `Talking of axes,' _p _a Duchess, `chop off _e head!'

  _n glanced rather anxiously at _a cook, to see _5 _d meant
to take _a hint; _u _a cook _l busily stirring _a soup, _b
seemed _k to be listening, _9 _d _w on again:  `Twenty-four
hours, I THINK; or is it twelve?  I--'

  `Oh, don't bother ME,' _p _a Duchess; `I never could abide
figures!'  And _h _f _d began nursing _e child again,
singing a sort of lullaby to it as _d did _9, _b giving it a
violent shake at _a end of every line:

        `Speak roughly to your little boy,
          And beat him when he sneezes:
        He only does it to annoy,
          Because he knows it teases.'

                    CHORUS.

    (In _7 _a cook _b _a baby joined):--

                `Wow! wow! wow!'

  While _a Duchess sang _a second verse of _a song, _d kept
tossing _a baby violently up _b _r, _b _a poor little _o
howled _9, _f _n could hardly hear _a words:--

        `I speak severely to _z boy,
          I beat him when he sneezes;
        For he can thoroughly enjoy
          The pepper when he pleases!'

                    CHORUS.

                `Wow! wow! wow!'

  `Here! _s may nurse it a bit, _5 _s like!' _a Duchess _p
to _n, flinging _a baby at _e as _d spoke.  `I must go _b
_x ready to play croquet _h _a Queen,' _b _d hurried _8 of
_a room.  The cook threw a frying-pan after _e as _d _w _8,
_u it just missed _e.

  _n caught _a baby _h some difficulty, as it _l a queer-
shaped little creature, _b held _8 its arms _b legs in _1
directions, `just like a star-fish,' thought _n.  The poor
little _o _l snorting like a steam-engine when _d caught it,
_b kept doubling itself up _b straightening itself _8 again,
_9 _f altogether, _j _a first minute or two, it _l as much
as _d could do to hold it.

  As soon as _d had made _8 _a proper way of nursing it,
(_7 _l to twist it up into a sort of knot, _b then keep
tight hold of its right ear _b left foot, _9 as to prevent its
undoing itself,) _d carried it _8 into _a open air.  `IF I
don't take _q child away _h me,' thought _n, `they're sure
to kill it in a day or two:  wouldn't it be murder to leave it
behind?'  She _p _a last words _8 loud, _b _a little _o
grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by _q time).  `Don't
grunt,' _p _n; `_f's _k at _1 a proper way of expressing
yourself.'

  The baby grunted again, _b _n looked _m anxiously into
its face to see _i _l _a matter _h it.  There could be no
doubt _f it had a VERY turn-up nose, much more like a snout
than a real nose; also its eyes were getting extremely small _j
a baby:  altogether _n did _k like _a look of _a _o at
_1.  `But perhaps it _l only sobbing,' _d thought, _b looked
into its eyes again, to see _5 _3 were any tears.

  No, _3 were no tears.  `If _s're going to turn into a pig,
_z dear,' _p _n, seriously, `I'll _g nothing more to do
_h _s.  Mind now!'  The poor little _o sobbed again (or
grunted, it _l impossible to _c _7), _b they _w on _j
some while in silence.

  _n _l just beginning to think to herself, `Now, _i am I
to do _h _q creature when I _x it home?' when it grunted
again, _9 violently, _f _d looked _r into its face in some
alarm.  This time _3 could be NO mistake _6 it:  it _l
neither more nor less than a pig, _b _d felt _f it _2 be
quite absurd _j _e to carry it further.

  So _d set _a little creature _r, _b felt quite relieved to
see it trot away quietly into _a wood.  `If it had grown up,'
_d _p to herself, `it _2 _g made a dreadfully ugly child:
_u it makes rather a handsome pig, I think.'  And _d began
thinking over other children _d knew, who might do _m well as
pigs, _b _l just saying to herself, `_5 _0 only knew _a right
way to change them--' when _d _l a little startled by seeing
_a Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off.

  The Cat only grinned when it saw _n.  It looked good-
natured, _d thought:  still it had VERY long claws _b a great
many teeth, _9 _d felt _f it ought to be treated _h respect.

  `Cheshire Puss,' _d began, rather timidly, as _d did _k at
_1 know whether it _2 like _a name:  however, it only
grinned a little wider.  `Come, it's pleased _9 far,' thought
_n, _b _d _w on.  `Would _s tell me, please, _7 way I
ought to go _v here?'

  `That depends a good deal on where _s want to _x to,' _p
_a Cat.

  `I don't much care where--' _p _n.

  `Then it doesn't matter _7 way _s go,' _p _a Cat.

  `--_9 long as I _x SOMEWHERE,' _n added as an explanation.

  `Oh, _s're sure to do _f,' _p _a Cat, `_5 _s only walk
long enough.'

  _n felt _f _q could _k be denied, _9 _d tried another
question.  `What sort of people live _6 here?'

  `In THAT direction,' _a Cat _p, waving its right paw round,
`lives a Hatter:  _b in THAT direction,' waving _a other paw,
`lives a March Hare.  Visit either _s like:  they're both mad.'

  `But I don't want to go among mad people,' _n remarked.

  `Oh, _s can't help _f,' _p _a Cat:  `we're _1 mad here.
I'm mad.  You're mad.'

  `How do _s know I'm mad?' _p _n.

  `You must be,' _p _a Cat, `or _s wouldn't _g come here.'

  _n didn't think _f proved it at _1; however, _d _w on
`And _t do _s know _f _s're mad?'

  `To begin _h,' _p _a Cat, `a dog's _k mad.  You grant
_f?'

  `I suppose _9,' _p _n.

  `Well, then,' _a Cat _w on, `_s see, a dog growls when it's
angry, _b wags its tail when it's pleased.  Now I growl when I'm
pleased, _b wag _z tail when I'm angry.  Therefore I'm mad.'

  `I call it purring, _k growling,' _p _n.

  `Call it _i _s like,' _p _a Cat.  `Do _s play croquet
_h _a Queen to-day?'

  `I should like it _m much,' _p _n, `_u I haven't been
invited yet.'

  `You'll see me _3,' _p _a Cat, _b vanished.

  _n _l _k much surprised at _q, _d _l getting _9 used
to queer things happening.  While _d _l looking at _a place
where it had been, it suddenly appeared again.

  `By-_a-bye, _i became of _a baby?' _p _a Cat.  `I'd
nearly forgotten to ask.'

  `It turned into a pig,' _n quietly _p, just as _5 it had
come back in a natural way.

  `I thought it _2,' _p _a Cat, _b vanished again.

  _n waited a little, half expecting to see it again, _u it
did _k appear, _b after a minute or two _d walked on in _a
direction in _7 _a March Hare _l _p to live.  `I've seen
hatters before,' _d _p to herself; `_a March Hare _y be
much _a most interesting, _b perhaps as _q is May it won't be
raving mad--at least _k _9 mad as it _l in March.'  As _d _p
_q, _d looked up, _b _3 _l _a Cat again, sitting on a
branch of a tree.

  `Did _s _c pig, or fig?' _p _a Cat.

  `I _p pig,' replied _n; `_b I wish _s wouldn't keep
appearing _b vanishing _9 suddenly:  _s make _0 quite giddy.'

  `All right,' _p _a Cat; _b _q time it vanished quite
slowly, beginning _h _a end of _a tail, _b ending _h _a
grin, _7 remained some time after _a rest of it had gone.

  `Well!  I've often seen a cat without a grin,' thought _n;
`_u a grin without a cat!  It's _a most curious _o I ever
_c in _z life!'

  She had _k gone much farther before _d came in sight of _a
house of _a March Hare:  _d thought it must be _a right house,
because _a chimneys were shaped like ears _b _a roof _l
thatched _h fur.  It _l _9 large a house, _f _d did _k
like to go nearer till _d had nibbled some more of _a lefthand
bit of mushroom, _b raised herself to _6 two feet high:  even
then _d walked up towards it rather timidly, saying to herself
`Suppose it should be raving mad after _1!  I almost wish I'd
gone to see _a Hatter instead!'



                           CHAPTER VII

                         A Mad Tea-Party


  There _l a table set _8 under a tree in front of _a house,
_b _a March Hare _b _a Hatter were having tea at it:  a
Dormouse _l sitting between them, fast asleep, _b _a other two
were using it as a cushion, resting _4 elbows on it, _b _a
talking over its head.  `Very uncomfortable _j _a Dormouse,'
thought _n; `only, as it's asleep, I suppose it doesn't mind.'

  The table _l a large _0, _u _a three were _1 crowded
together at _0 corner of it:  `No room!  No room!' they cried
_8 when they saw _n coming.  `There's PLENTY of room!' _p
_n indignantly, _b _d sat _r in a large arm-chair at _0
end of _a table.

  `Have some wine,' _a March Hare _p in an encouraging tone.

  _n looked _1 round _a table, _u _3 _l nothing on it
_u tea.  `I don't see any wine,' _d remarked.

  `There isn't any,' _p _a March Hare.

  `Then it wasn't _m civil of _s to offer it,' _p _n
angrily.

  `It wasn't _m civil of _s to sit _r without being
invited,' _p _a March Hare.

  `I didn't know it _l YOUR table,' _p _n; `it's laid _j a
great many more than three.'

  `Your hair wants cutting,' _p _a Hatter.  He had been
looking at _n _j some time _h great curiosity, _b _q _l
his first speech.

  `You should learn _k to make personal remarks,' _n _p
_h some severity; `it's _m rude.'

  The Hatter opened his eyes _m wide on hearing _q; _u _1
he SAID _l, `Why is a raven like a writing-desk?'

  `Come, we shall _g some fun now!' thought _n.  `I'm glad
they've begun asking riddles.--I believe I can guess _f,' _d
added aloud.

  `Do _s mean _f _s think _s can find _8 _a answer to it?'
_p _a March Hare.

  `Exactly _9,' _p _n.

  `Then _s should _c _i _s mean,' _a March Hare _w on.

  `I do,' _n hastily replied; `at least--at least I mean _i
I _c--_f's _a same _o, _s know.'

  `Not _a same _o a bit!' _p _a Hatter.  `You might just
as well _c _f "I see _i I eat" is _a same _o as "I eat
_i I see"!'

  `You might just as well _c,' added _a March Hare, `_f "I
like _i I _x" is _a same _o as "I _x _i I like"!'

  `You might just as well _c,' added _a Dormouse, who seemed to
be talking in his sleep, `_f "I breathe when I sleep" is _a
same _o as "I sleep when I breathe"!'

  `It IS _a same _o _h _s,' _p _a Hatter, _b here _a
conversation dropped, _b _a party sat silent _j a minute,
while _n thought over _1 _d could remember _6 ravens _b
writing-desks, _7 wasn't much.

  The Hatter _l _a first to break _a silence.  `What day of
_a month is it?' he _p, turning to _n:  he had taken his
watch _8 of his pocket, _b _l looking at it uneasily, shaking
it every now _b then, _b holding it to his ear.

  _n considered a little, _b then _p `The fourth.'

  `Two days wrong!' sighed _a Hatter.  `I told _s butter
wouldn't suit _a works!' he added looking angrily at _a March
Hare.

  `It _l _a BEST butter,' _a March Hare meekly replied.

  `Yes, _u some crumbs must _g got in as well,' _a Hatter
grumbled:  `_s shouldn't _g put it in _h _a bread-knife.'

  The March Hare took _a watch _b looked at it gloomily:  then
he dipped it into his cup of tea, _b looked at it again:  _u he
could think of nothing better to _c than his first remark, `It
_l _a BEST butter, _s know.'

  _n had been looking over his shoulder _h some curiosity.
`What a funny watch!' _d remarked.  `It tells _a day of _a
month, _b doesn't tell _i o'clock it is!'

  `Why should it?' muttered _a Hatter.  `Does YOUR watch tell
_s _i year it is?'

  `Of course _k,' _n replied _m readily:  `_u _f's
because it stays _a same year _j such a long time together.'

  `Which is just _a case _h MINE,' _p _a Hatter.

  _n felt dreadfully puzzled.  The Hatter's remark seemed to
_g no sort of meaning in it, _b yet it _l certainly English.
`I don't quite understand _s,' _d _p, as politely as _d
could.

  `The Dormouse is asleep again,' _p _a Hatter, _b he poured
a little hot tea upon its nose.

  The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, _b _p, without
opening its eyes, `Of course, of course; just _i I _l going to
remark myself.'

  `Have _s guessed _a riddle yet?' _a Hatter _p, turning to
_n again.

  `No, I give it up,' _n replied:  `_i's _a answer?'

  `I haven't _a slightest idea,' _p _a Hatter.

  `Nor I,' _p _a March Hare.

  _n sighed wearily.  `I think _s might do something better
_h _a time,' _d _p, `than waste it in asking riddles _f
_g no answers.'

  `If _s knew Time as well as I do,' _p _a Hatter, `_s
wouldn't talk _6 wasting IT.  It's HIM.'

  `I don't know _i _s mean,' _p _n.

  `Of course _s don't!' _a Hatter _p, tossing his head
contemptuously.  `I dare _c _s never even spoke to Time!'

  `Perhaps _k,' _n cautiously replied:  `_u I know I _g to
beat time when I learn music.'

  `Ah! _f accounts _j it,' _p _a Hatter.  `He won't stand
beating.  Now, _5 _s only kept on good terms _h him, he'd do
almost anything _s liked _h _a clock.  For instance, suppose
it were nine o'clock in _a morning, just time to begin lessons:
_s'd only _g to whisper a hint to Time, _b round goes _a
clock in a twinkling!  Half-past _0, time _j dinner!'

  (`I only wish it _l,' _a March Hare _p to itself in a
whisper.)

  `That _2 be grand, certainly,' _p _n thoughtfully:
`_u then--I shouldn't be hungry _j it, _s know.'

  `Not at first, perhaps,' _p _a Hatter:  `_u _s could keep
it to half-past _0 as long as _s liked.'

  `Is _f _a way YOU manage?' _n asked.

  The Hatter shook his head mournfully.  `Not I!' he replied.
`We quarrelled last March--just before HE _w mad, _s know--'
(pointing _h his tea spoon at _a March Hare,) `--it _l at _a
great concert given by _a Queen of Hearts, _b I had to sing

            "Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!
            How I wonder _i _s're at!"

You know _a song, perhaps?'

  `I've heard something like it,' _p _n.

  `It goes on, _s know,' _a Hatter continued, `in _q way:--

            "Up above _a world _s fly,
            Like a tea-tray in _a sky.
                    Twinkle, twinkle--"'

Here _a Dormouse shook itself, _b began singing in its sleep
`Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle--' _b _w on _9 long _f
they had to pinch it to make it stop.

  `Well, I'd hardly finished _a first verse,' _p _a Hatter,
`when _a Queen jumped up _b bawled _8, "He's murdering _a
time!  Off _h his head!"'

  `How dreadfully savage!' exclaimed _n.

  `And ever since _f,' _a Hatter _w on in a mournful tone,
`he won't do a _o I ask!  It's always six o'clock now.'

  A bright idea came into _n's head.  `Is _f _a reason _9
many tea-things are put _8 here?' _d asked.

  `Yes, _f's it,' _p _a Hatter _h a sigh:  `it's always
tea-time, _b we've no time to wash _a things between whiles.'

  `Then _s keep moving round, I suppose?' _p _n.

  `Exactly _9,' _p _a Hatter:  `as _a things _x used up.'

  `But _i happens when _s come to _a beginning again?' _n
ventured to ask.

  `Suppose we change _a subject,' _a March Hare interrupted,
yawning.  `I'm getting tired of _q.  I vote _a young lady
tells us a story.'

  `I'm afraid I don't know _0,' _p _n, rather alarmed at
_a proposal.

  `Then _a Dormouse shall!' they both cried.  `Wake up,
Dormouse!'  And they pinched it on both sides at once.

  The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes.  `I wasn't asleep,' he
_p in a hoarse, feeble voice:  `I heard every word _s fellows
were saying.'

  `Tell us a story!' _p _a March Hare.

  `Yes, please do!' pleaded _n.

  `And be quick _6 it,' added _a Hatter, `or _s'll be asleep
again before it's done.'

  `Once upon a time _3 were three little sisters,' _a
Dormouse began in a great hurry; `_b _4 names were Elsie,
Lacie, _b Tillie; _b they lived at _a bottom of a well--'

  `What did they live on?' _p _n, who always took a great
interest in questions of eating _b drinking.

  `They lived on treacle,' _p _a Dormouse, after thinking a
minute or two.

  `They couldn't _g done _f, _s know,' _n gently
remarked; `they'd _g been ill.'

  `So they were,' _p _a Dormouse; `VERY ill.'

  _n tried to fancy to herself _i such an extraordinary ways
of living _2 be like, _u it puzzled _e too much, _9 _d _w
on:  `But why did they live at _a bottom of a well?'

  `Take some more tea,' _a March Hare _p to _n, _m
earnestly.

  `I've had nothing yet,' _n replied in an offended tone, `_9
I can't take more.'

  `You mean _s can't take LESS,' _p _a Hatter:  `it's _m
easy to take MORE than nothing.'

  `Nobody asked YOUR opinion,' _p _n.

  `Who's making personal remarks now?' _a Hatter asked
triumphantly.

  _n did _k quite know _i to _c to _q:  _9 _d helped
herself to some tea _b bread-_b-butter, _b then turned to _a
Dormouse, _b repeated _e question.  `Why did they live at _a
bottom of a well?'

  The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think _6 it, _b
then _p, `It _l a treacle-well.'

  `There's no such _o!'  _n _l beginning _m angrily, _u
_a Hatter _b _a March Hare _w `Sh! sh!' _b _a Dormouse
sulkily remarked, `If _s can't be civil, _s'd better finish _a
story _j yourself.'

  `No, please go on!' _n _p _m humbly; `I won't interrupt
again.  I dare _c _3 may be ONE.'

  `One, indeed!' _p _a Dormouse indignantly.  However, he
consented to go on.  `And _9 these three little sisters--they
were learning to draw, _s know--'

  `What did they draw?' _p _n, quite forgetting _e promise.

  `Treacle,' _p _a Dormouse, without considering at _1 _q
time.

  `I want a clean cup,' interrupted _a Hatter:  `let's _1 move
_0 place on.'

  He moved on as he spoke, _b _a Dormouse followed him:  _a
March Hare moved into _a Dormouse's place, _b _n rather
unwillingly took _a place of _a March Hare.  The Hatter _l _a
only _0 who got any advantage _v _a change:  _b _n _l a
good deal worse off than before, as _a March Hare had just upset
_a milk-jug into his plate.

  _n did _k wish to offend _a Dormouse again, _9 _d began
_m cautiously:  `But I don't understand.  Where did they draw
_a treacle _v?'

  `You can draw water _8 of a water-well,' _p _a Hatter; `_9
I should think _s could draw treacle _8 of a treacle-well--eh,
stupid?'

  `But they were IN _a well,' _n _p to _a Dormouse, _k
choosing to notice _q last remark.

  `Of course they were', _p _a Dormouse; `--well in.'

  This answer _9 confused poor _n, _f _d let _a Dormouse
go on _j some time without interrupting it.

  `They were learning to draw,' _a Dormouse _w on, yawning _b
rubbing its eyes, _j it _l getting _m sleepy; `_b they drew
_1 manner of things--everything _f begins _h an M--'

  `Why _h an M?' _p _n.

  `Why _k?' _p _a March Hare.

  _n _l silent.

  The Dormouse had closed its eyes by _q time, _b _l going
off into a doze; _u, on being pinched by _a Hatter, it woke up
again _h a little shriek, _b _w on:  `--_f begins _h an
M, such as mouse-traps, _b _a moon, _b memory, _b muchness--
_s know _s _c things are "much of a muchness"--did _s ever
see such a _o as a drawing of a muchness?'

  `Really, now _s ask me,' _p _n, _m much confused, `I
don't think--'

  `Then _s shouldn't talk,' _p _a Hatter.

  This piece of rudeness _l more than _n could bear:  _d got
up in great disgust, _b walked off; _a Dormouse fell asleep
instantly, _b neither of _a others took _a least notice of _e
going, though _d looked back once or twice, half hoping _f
they _2 call after _e:  _a last time _d saw them, they were
trying to put _a Dormouse into _a teapot.

  `At any rate I'll never go THERE again!' _p _n as _d
picked _e way through _a wood.  `It's _a stupidest tea-party I
ever _l at in _1 _z life!'

  Just as _d _p _q, _d noticed _f _0 of _a trees had a
door leading right into it.  `That's _m curious!' _d thought.
`But everything's curious today.  I think I may as well go in at
once.'  And in _d _w.

  Once more _d found herself in _a long hall, _b close to _a
little glass table.  `Now, I'll manage better _q time,' _d
_p to herself, _b began by taking _a little golden key, _b
unlocking _a door _f led into _a garden.  Then _d _w to
work nibbling at _a mushroom (_d had kept a piece of it in _e
pocked) till _d _l _6 a foot high:  then _d walked _r _a
little passage:  _b THEN--_d found herself at last in _a
beautiful garden, among _a bright flower-beds _b _a cool
fountains.



                          CHAPTER VIII

                   The Queen's Croquet-Ground


  A large rose-tree stood near _a entrance of _a garden:  _a
roses growing on it were white, _u _3 were three gardeners at
it, busily painting them red.  _n thought _q a _m curious
_o, _b _d _w nearer to watch them, _b just as _d came up
to them _d heard _0 of them _c, `Look _8 now, Five!  Don't go
splashing paint over me like _f!'

  `I couldn't help it,' _p Five, in a sulky tone; `Seven jogged
_z elbow.'

  On _7 Seven looked up _b _p, `That's right, Five!  Always
lay _a blame on others!'

  `YOU'D better _k talk!' _p Five.  `I heard _a Queen _c only
yesterday _s deserved to be beheaded!'

  `What _j?' _p _a _0 who had spoken first.

  `That's none of YOUR business, Two!' _p Seven.

  `Yes, it IS his business!' _p Five, `_b I'll tell him--it
_l _j bringing _a cook tulip-roots instead of onions.'

  Seven flung _r his brush, _b had just begun `Well, of _1
_a unjust things--' when his eye chanced to fall upon _n, as
_d stood watching them, _b he checked himself suddenly:  _a
others looked round also, _b _1 of them bowed low.

  `Would _s tell me,' _p _n, a little timidly, `why _s are
painting those roses?'

  Five _b Seven _p nothing, _u looked at Two.  Two began in a
low voice, `Why _a fact is, _s see, Miss, _q here ought to
_g been a RED rose-tree, _b we put a white _0 in by mistake;
_b _5 _a Queen _l to find it _8, we should _1 _g our heads
cut off, _s know.  So _s see, Miss, we're doing our best, afore
_d comes, to--'  At _q moment Five, who had been anxiously
looking across _a garden, called _8 `The Queen!  The Queen!'
_b _a three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon
_4 faces.  There _l a sound of many footsteps, _b _n
looked round, eager to see _a Queen.

  First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were _1 shaped
like _a three gardeners, oblong _b flat, _h _4 hands _b
feet at _a corners:  next _a ten courtiers; these were
ornamented _1 over _h diamonds, _b walked two _b two, as _a
soldiers did.  After these came _a royal children; _3 were
ten of them, _b _a little dears came jumping merrily along hand
in hand, in couples:  they were _1 ornamented _h hearts.  Next
came _a guests, mostly Kings _b Queens, _b among them _n
recognised _a White Rabbit:  it _l talking in a hurried nervous
manner, smiling at everything _f _l _p, _b _w by without
noticing _e.  Then followed _a Knave of Hearts, carrying _a
King's crown on a crimson velvet cushion; _b, last of _1 _q
grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.

  _n _l rather doubtful whether _d ought _k to lie _r on
_e face like _a three gardeners, _u _d could _k remember
every having heard of such a rule at processions; `_b besides,
_i _2 be _a use of a procession,' thought _d, `_5 people
had _1 to lie _r upon _4 faces, _9 _f they couldn't see
it?'  So _d stood still where _d _l, _b waited.

  When _a procession came opposite to _n, they _1 stopped
_b looked at _e, _b _a Queen _p severely `Who is _q?'
She _p it to _a Knave of Hearts, who only bowed _b smiled in
reply.

  `Idiot!' _p _a Queen, tossing _e head impatiently; _b,
turning to _n, _d _w on, `What's your name, child?'

  `My name is _n, _9 please your Majesty,' _p _n _m
politely; _u _d added, to herself, `Why, they're only a pack of
cards, after _1.  I needn't be afraid of them!'

  `And who are THESE?' _p _a Queen, pointing to _a three
gardeners who were lying round _a rosetree; _j, _s see, as
they were lying on _4 faces, _b _a pattern on _4 backs
_l _a same as _a rest of _a pack, _d could _k tell whether
they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of _e
own children.

  `How should I know?' _p _n, surprised at _e own courage.
`It's no business of MINE.'

  The Queen turned crimson _h fury, _b, after glaring at _e
_j a moment like a wild beast, screamed `Off _h _e head!
Off--'

  `Nonsense!' _p _n, _m loudly _b decidedly, _b _a
Queen _l silent.

  The King laid his hand upon _e arm, _b timidly _p
`Consider, _z dear:  _d is only a child!'

  The Queen turned angrily away _v him, _b _p to _a Knave
`Turn them over!'

  The Knave did _9, _m carefully, _h _0 foot.

  `Get up!' _p _a Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, _b _a
three gardeners instantly jumped up, _b began bowing to _a
King, _a Queen, _a royal children, _b everybody else.

  `Leave off _f!' screamed _a Queen.  `You make me giddy.'
And then, turning to _a rose-tree, _d _w on, `What HAVE _s
been doing here?'

  `May it please your Majesty,' _p Two, in a _m humble tone,
going _r on _0 knee as he spoke, `we were trying--'

  `I see!' _p _a Queen, who had meanwhile been examining _a
roses.  `Off _h _4 heads!' _b _a procession moved on,
three of _a soldiers remaining behind to execute _a unfortunate
gardeners, who ran to _n _j protection.

  `You shan't be beheaded!' _p _n, _b _d put them into a
large flower-pot _f stood near.  The three soldiers wandered
_6 _j a minute or two, looking _j them, _b then quietly
marched off after _a others.

  `Are _4 heads off?' shouted _a Queen.

  `Their heads are gone, _5 it please your Majesty!' _a soldiers
shouted in reply.

  `That's right!' shouted _a Queen.  `Can _s play croquet?'

  The soldiers were silent, _b looked at _n, as _a question
_l evidently meant _j _e.

  `Yes!' shouted _n.

  `Come on, then!' roared _a Queen, _b _n joined _a
procession, wondering _m much _i _2 happen next.

  `It's--it's a _m fine day!' _p a timid voice at _e side.
She _l walking by _a White Rabbit, who _l peeping anxiously
into _e face.

  `Very,' _p _n:  `--where's _a Duchess?'

  `Hush!  Hush!' _p _a Rabbit in a low, hurried tone.  He
looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, _b then raised
himself upon tiptoe, put his mouth close to _e ear, _b
whispered `She's under sentence of execution.'

  `What _j?' _p _n.

  `Did _s _c "What a pity!"?' _a Rabbit asked.

  `No, I didn't,' _p _n:  `I don't think it's at _1 a pity.
I _p "What _j?"'

  `She boxed _a Queen's ears--' _a Rabbit began.  _n gave a
little scream of laughter.  `Oh, hush!' _a Rabbit whispered in a
frightened tone.  `The Queen _y hear _s!  You see, _d came
rather late, _b _a Queen _p--'

  `Get to your places!' shouted _a Queen in a voice of thunder,
_b people began running _6 in _1 directions, tumbling up
against each other; however, they got settled _r in a minute or
two, _b _a game began.  _n thought _d had never seen such a
curious croquet-ground in _e life; it _l _1 ridges _b
furrows; _a balls were live hedgehogs, _a mallets live
flamingoes, _b _a soldiers had to double themselves up _b to
stand on _4 hands _b feet, to make _a arches.

  The chief difficulty _n found at first _l in managing _e
flamingo:  _d succeeded in getting its body tucked away,
comfortably enough, under _e arm, _h its legs hanging _r,
_u generally, just as _d had got its neck nicely straightened
_8, _b _l going to give _a hedgehog a blow _h its head, it
WOULD twist itself round _b look up in _e face, _h such a
puzzled expression _f _d could _k help bursting _8 laughing:
_b when _d had got its head _r, _b _l going to begin again,
it _l _m provoking to find _f _a hedgehog had unrolled
itself, _b _l in _a act of crawling away:  besides _1 _q,
_3 _l generally a ridge or furrow in _a way wherever _d
wanted to send _a hedgehog to, _b, as _a doubled-up soldiers
were always getting up _b walking off to other parts of _a
ground, _n soon came to _a conclusion _f it _l a _m
difficult game indeed.

  The players _1 played at once without waiting _j turns,
quarrelling _1 _a while, _b fighting _j _a hedgehogs; _b in
a _m short time _a Queen _l in a furious passion, _b _w
stamping _6, _b shouting `Off _h his head!' or `Off _h
_e head!' _6 once in a minute.

  _n began to feel _m uneasy:  to be sure, _d had _k as
yet had any dispute _h _a Queen, _u _d knew _f it might
happen any minute, `_b then,' thought _d, `_i _2 become of
me?  They're dreadfully fond of beheading people here; _a great
wonder is, _f _3's any _0 left alive!'

  She _l looking _6 _j some way of escape, _b wondering
whether _d could _x away without being seen, when _d noticed a
curious appearance in _a air:  it puzzled _e _m much at
first, _u, after watching it a minute or two, _d made it _8 to
be a grin, _b _d _p to herself `It's _a Cheshire Cat:  now I
shall _g somebody to talk to.'

  `How are _s getting on?' _p _a Cat, as soon as _3 _l
mouth enough _j it to speak _h.

  _n waited till _a eyes appeared, _b then nodded.  `It's no
use speaking to it,' _d thought, `till its ears _g come, or at
least _0 of them.'  In another minute _a whole head appeared,
_b then _n put _r _e flamingo, _b began an account of _a
game, feeling _m glad _d had someone to listen to _e.  The
Cat seemed to think _f _3 _l enough of it now in sight, _b
no more of it appeared.

  `I don't think they play at _1 fairly,' _n began, in rather
a complaining tone, `_b they _1 quarrel _9 dreadfully _0 can't
hear oneself speak--_b they don't seem to _g any rules in
particular; at least, _5 _3 are, nobody attends to them--_b
_s've no idea _t confusing it is _1 _a things being alive;
_j instance, _3's _a arch I've got to go through next
walking _6 at _a other end of _a ground--_b I should _g
croqueted _a Queen's hedgehog just now, only it ran away when it
saw mine coming!'

  `How do _s like _a Queen?' _p _a Cat in a low voice.

  `Not at _1,' _p _n:  `_d's _9 extremely--'  Just then
_d noticed _f _a Queen _l close behind _e, listening:  _9
_d _w on, `--likely to win, _f it's hardly worth while
finishing _a game.'

  The Queen smiled _b passed on.

  `Who ARE _s talking to?' _p _a King, going up to _n, _b
looking at _a Cat's head _h great curiosity.

  `It's a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat,' _p _n:  `allow me
to introduce it.'

  `I don't like _a look of it at _1,' _p _a King:  `however,
it may kiss _z hand _5 it likes.'

  `I'd rather _k,' _a Cat remarked.

  `Don't be impertinent,' _p _a King, `_b don't look at me
like _f!'  He got behind _n as he spoke.

  `A cat may look at a king,' _p _n.  `I've read _f in
some book, _u I don't remember where.'

  `Well, it must be removed,' _p _a King _m decidedly, _b
he called _a Queen, who _l passing at _a moment, `My dear!  I
wish _s _2 _g _q cat removed!'

  The Queen had only _0 way of settling _1 difficulties, great
or small.  `Off _h his head!' _d _p, without even looking
round.

  `I'll fetch _a executioner myself,' _p _a King eagerly, _b
he hurried off.

  _n thought _d might as well go back, _b see _t _a game
_l going on, as _d heard _a Queen's voice in _a distance,
screaming _h passion.  She had already heard _e sentence three
of _a players to be executed _j having missed _4 turns, _b
_d did _k like _a look of things at _1, as _a game _l in
such confusion _f _d never knew whether it _l _e turn or
_k.  So _d _w in search of _e hedgehog.

  The hedgehog _l engaged in a fight _h another hedgehog,
_7 seemed to _n an excellent opportunity _j croqueting _0
of them _h _a other:  _a only difficulty _l, _f _e
flamingo _l gone across to _a other side of _a garden, where
_n could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up
into a tree.

  By _a time _d had caught _a flamingo _b brought it back,
_a fight _l over, _b both _a hedgehogs were _8 of sight:
`_u it doesn't matter much,' thought _n, `as _1 _a arches
are gone _v _q side of _a ground.'  So _d tucked it away
under _e arm, _f it might _k escape again, _b _w back _j
a little more conversation _h _e friend.

  When _d got back to _a Cheshire Cat, _d _l surprised to
find quite a large crowd collected round it:  _3 _l a dispute
going on between _a executioner, _a King, _b _a Queen, who
were _1 talking at once, while _1 _a rest were quite silent,
_b looked _m uncomfortable.

  The moment _n appeared, _d _l appealed to by _1 three to
settle _a question, _b they repeated _4 arguments to _e,
though, as they _1 spoke at once, _d found it _m hard indeed
to make _8 exactly _i they _p.

  The executioner's argument _l, _f _s couldn't cut off a
head unless _3 _l a body to cut it off _v:  _f he had
never had to do such a _o before, _b he wasn't going to begin
at HIS time of life.

  The King's argument _l, _f anything _f had a head could be
beheaded, _b _f _s weren't to talk nonsense.

  The Queen's argument _l, _f _5 something wasn't done _6
it in less than no time _d'd _g everybody executed, _1 round.
(It _l _q last remark _f had made _a whole party look _9
grave _b anxious.)

  _n could think of nothing else to _c _u `It belongs to _a
Duchess:  _s'd better ask HER _6 it.'

  `She's in prison,' _a Queen _p to _a executioner:  `fetch
_e here.'  And _a executioner _w off like an arrow.

   The Cat's head began fading away _a moment he _l gone, _b,
by _a time he had come back _h _a Dutchess, it had entirely
disappeared; _9 _a King _b _a executioner ran wildly up _b
_r looking _j it, while _a rest of _a party _w back to _a game.



                           CHAPTER IX

                     The Mock Turtle's Story


  `You can't think _t glad I am to see _s again, _s dear old
_o!' _p _a Duchess, as _d tucked _e arm affectionately
into _n's, _b they walked off together.

  _n _l _m glad to find _e in such a pleasant temper, _b
thought to herself _f perhaps it _l only _a pepper _f had
made _e _9 savage when they met in _a kitchen.

  `When I'M a Duchess,' _d _p to herself, (_k in a _m
hopeful tone though), `I won't _g any pepper in _z kitchen AT
ALL.  Soup does _m well without--Maybe it's always pepper _f
makes people hot-tempered,' _d _w on, _m much pleased at
having found _8 a new kind of rule, `_b vinegar _f makes them
sour--_b camomile _f makes them bitter--_b--_b barley-sugar
_b such things _f make children sweet-tempered.  I only wish
people knew _f:  then they wouldn't be _9 stingy _6 it, _s
know--'

  She had quite forgotten _a Duchess by _q time, _b _l a
little startled when _d heard _e voice close to _e ear.
`You're thinking _6 something, _z dear, _b _f makes _s
forget to talk.  I can't tell _s just now _i _a moral of _f
is, _u I shall remember it in a bit.'

  `Perhaps it hasn't _0,' _n ventured to remark.

  `Tut, tut, child!' _p _a Duchess.  `Everything's got a
moral, _5 only _s can find it.'  And _d squeezed herself up
closer to _n's side as _d spoke.

  _n did _k much like keeping _9 close to _e:  first,
because _a Duchess _l VERY ugly; _b secondly, because _d _l
exactly _a right height to rest _e chin upon _n's shoulder,
_b it _l an uncomfortably sharp chin.  However, _d did _k
like to be rude, _9 _d bore it as well as _d could.

  `The game's going on rather better now,' _d _p, by way of
keeping up _a conversation a little.

  `'Tis _9,' _p _a Duchess:  `_b _a moral of _f is--"Oh,
'tis love, 'tis love, _f makes _a world go round!"'

  `Somebody _p,' _n whispered, `_f it's done by everybody
minding _4 own business!'

  `Ah, well!  It means much _a same _o,' _p _a Duchess,
digging _e sharp little chin into _n's shoulder as _d added,
`_b _a moral of THAT is--"Take care of _a sense, _b _a
sounds _y take care of themselves."'

  `How fond _d is of finding morals in things!' _n thought to
herself.

  `I dare _c _s're wondering why I don't put _z arm round your
waist,' _a Duchess _p after a pause:  `_a reason is, _f I'm
doubtful _6 _a temper of your flamingo.  Shall I try _a
experiment?'

  `HE might bite,' _n cautiously replied, _k feeling at _1
anxious to _g _a experiment tried.

  `Very true,' _p _a Duchess:  `flamingoes _b mustard both
bite.  And _a moral of _f is--"Birds of a feather flock
together."'

  `Only mustard isn't a bird,' _n remarked.

  `Right, as usual,' _p _a Duchess:  `_i a clear way _s
_g of putting things!'

  `It's a mineral, I THINK,' _p _n.

  `Of course it is,' _p _a Duchess, who seemed ready to agree
to everything _f _n _p; `_3's a large mustard-mine near
here.  And _a moral of _f is--"The more _3 is of mine, _a
less _3 is of yours."'

  `Oh, I know!' exclaimed _n, who had _k attended to _q
last remark, `it's a vegetable.  It doesn't look like _0, _u it
is.'

  `I quite agree _h _s,' _p _a Duchess; `_b _a moral of
_f is--"Be _i _s _2 seem to be"--or _5 _s'd like it put
more simply--"Never imagine yourself _k to be otherwise than
_i it might appear to others _f _i _s were or might _g
been _l _k otherwise than _i _s had been _2 _g appeared
to them to be otherwise."'

  `I think I should understand _f better,' _n _p _m
politely, `_5 I had it written _r:  _u I can't quite follow it
as _s _c it.'

  `That's nothing to _i I could _c _5 I chose,' _a Duchess
replied, in a pleased tone.

  `Pray don't trouble yourself to _c it any longer than _f,'
_p _n.

  `Oh, don't talk _6 trouble!' _p _a Duchess.  `I make _s
a present of everything I've _p as yet.'

  `A cheap sort of present!' thought _n.  `I'm glad they don't
give birthday presents like _f!'  But _d did _k venture to
_c it _8 loud.

  `Thinking again?' _a Duchess asked, _h another dig of _e
sharp little chin.

  `I've a right to think,' _p _n sharply, _j _d _l
beginning to feel a little worried.

  `Just _6 as much right,' _p _a Duchess, `as pigs _g to
fly; _b _a m--'

  But here, to _n's great surprise, _a Duchess's voice died
away, even in _a middle of _e favourite word `moral,' _b _a
arm _f _l linked into hers began to tremble.  _n looked up,
_b _3 stood _a Queen in front of them, _h _e arms folded,
frowning like a thunderstorm.

  `A fine day, your Majesty!' _a Duchess began in a low, weak
voice.

  `Now, I give _s fair warning,' shouted _a Queen, stamping on
_a ground as _d spoke; `either _s or your head must be off,
_b _f in _6 half no time!  Take your choice!'

  The Duchess took _e choice, _b _l gone in a moment.

  `Let's go on _h _a game,' _a Queen _p to _n; _b _n
_l too much frightened to _c a word, _u slowly followed _e
back to _a croquet-ground.

  The other guests had taken advantage of _a Queen's absence,
_b were resting in _a shade:  however, _a moment they saw _e,
they hurried back to _a game, _a Queen merely remarking _f a
moment's delay _2 cost them _4 lives.

  All _a time they were playing _a Queen never left off
quarrelling _h _a other players, _b shouting `Off _h his
head!' or `Off _h _e head!'  Those whom _d sentenced were
taken into custody by _a soldiers, who of course had to leave
off being arches to do _q, _9 _f by _a end of half an hour
or _9 _3 were no arches left, _b _1 _a players, except _a
King, _a Queen, _b _n, were in custody _b under sentence of
execution.

  Then _a Queen left off, quite _8 of breath, _b _p to
_n, `Have _s seen _a Mock Turtle yet?'

  `No,' _p _n.  `I don't even know _i a Mock Turtle is.'

  `It's _a _o Mock Turtle Soup is made _v,' _p _a Queen.

  `I never saw _0, or heard of _0,' _p _n.

  `Come on, then,' _p _a Queen, `_b he shall tell _s his
history,'

  As they walked off together, _n heard _a King _c in a low
voice, to _a company generally, `You are _1 pardoned.'  `Come,
THAT'S a good _o!' _d _p to herself, _j _d had felt quite
unhappy at _a number of executions _a Queen had ordered.

  They _m soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in _a
sun.  (IF _s don't know _i a Gryphon is, look at _a picture.)
`Up, lazy _o!' _p _a Queen, `_b take _q young lady to
see _a Mock Turtle, _b to hear his history.  I must go back _b
see after some executions I _g ordered'; _b _d walked off,
leaving _n alone _h _a Gryphon.  _n did _k quite like
_a look of _a creature, _u on _a whole _d thought it _2
be quite as safe to stay _h it as to go after _f savage
Queen:  _9 _d waited.

  The Gryphon sat up _b rubbed its eyes:  then it watched _a
Queen till _d _l _8 of sight:  then it chuckled.  `What fun!'
_p _a Gryphon, half to itself, half to _n.

  `What IS _a fun?' _p _n.

  `Why, SHE,' _p _a Gryphon.  `It's _1 _e fancy, _f:  they
never executes nobody, _s know.  Come on!'

  `Everybody says "come on!" here,' thought _n, as _d _w
slowly after it:  `I never _l _9 ordered _6 in _1 _z life,
never!'

  They had _k gone far before they saw _a Mock Turtle in _a
distance, sitting sad _b lonely on a little ledge of rock, _b,
as they came nearer, _n could hear him sighing as _5 his heart
_2 break.  She pitied him deeply.  `What is his sorrow?' _d
asked _a Gryphon, _b _a Gryphon answered, _m nearly in _a
same words as before, `It's _1 his fancy, _f:  he hasn't got
no sorrow, _s know.  Come on!'

  So they _w up to _a Mock Turtle, who looked at them _h
large eyes full of tears, _u _p nothing.

  `This here young lady,' _p _a Gryphon, `_d wants _j to
know your history, _d do.'

  `I'll tell it _e,' _p _a Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow
tone:  `sit _r, both of _s, _b don't speak a word till I've
finished.'

  So they sat _r, _b nobody spoke _j some minutes.  _n
thought to herself, `I don't see _t he can EVEN finish, _5 he
doesn't begin.'  But _d waited patiently.

  `Once,' _p _a Mock Turtle at last, _h a deep sigh, `I _l
a real Turtle.'

  These words were followed by a _m long silence, broken only
by an occasional exclamation of `Hjckrrh!' _v _a Gryphon, _b
_a constant heavy sobbing of _a Mock Turtle.  _n _l _m
nearly getting up _b saying, `Thank _s, sir, _j your
interesting story,' _u _d could _k help thinking _3 MUST be
more to come, _9 _d sat still _b _p nothing.

  `When we were little,' _a Mock Turtle _w on at last, more
calmly, though still sobbing a little now _b then, `we _w to
school in _a sea.  The master _l an old Turtle--we used to call
him Tortoise--'

  `Why did _s call him Tortoise, _5 he wasn't _0?' _n asked.

  `We called him Tortoise because he taught us,' _p _a Mock
Turtle angrily:  `really _s are _m dull!'

  `You ought to be ashamed of yourself _j asking such a simple
question,' added _a Gryphon; _b then they both sat silent _b
looked at poor _n, who felt ready to sink into _a earth.  At
last _a Gryphon _p to _a Mock Turtle, `Drive on, old fellow!
Don't be _1 day _6 it!' _b he _w on in these words:

  `Yes, we _w to school in _a sea, though _s mayn't believe
it--'

  `I never _p I didn't!' interrupted _n.

  `You did,' _p _a Mock Turtle.

  `Hold your tongue!' added _a Gryphon, before _n could speak
again.  The Mock Turtle _w on.

  `We had _a best of educations--in fact, we _w to school
every day--'

  `I'VE been to a day-school, too,' _p _n; `_s needn't be
_9 proud as _1 _f.'

  `With extras?' asked _a Mock Turtle a little anxiously.

  `Yes,' _p _n, `we learned French _b music.'

  `And washing?' _p _a Mock Turtle.

  `Certainly _k!' _p _n indignantly.

  `Ah! then yours wasn't a really good school,' _p _a Mock
Turtle in a tone of great relief.  `Now at OURS they had at _a
end of _a bill, "French, music, AND WASHING--extra."'

  `You couldn't _g wanted it much,' _p _n; `living at _a
bottom of _a sea.'

  `I couldn't afford to learn it.' _p _a Mock Turtle _h a
sigh.  `I only took _a regular course.'

  `What _l _f?' inquired _n.

  `Reeling _b Writhing, of course, to begin _h,' _a Mock
Turtle replied; `_b then _a different branches of Arithmetic--
Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, _b Derision.'

  `I never heard of "Uglification,"' _n ventured to _c.  `What
is it?'

  The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise.  `What!  Never
heard of uglifying!' it exclaimed.  `You know _i to beautify
is, I suppose?'

  `Yes,' _p _n doubtfully:  `it means--to--make--anything--
prettier.'

  `Well, then,' _a Gryphon _w on, `_5 _s don't know _i to
uglify is, _s ARE a simpleton.'

  _n did _k feel encouraged to ask any more questions _6
it, _9 _d turned to _a Mock Turtle, _b _p `What else had _s
to learn?'

  `Well, _3 _l Mystery,' _a Mock Turtle replied, counting
off _a subjects on his flappers, `--Mystery, ancient _b modern,
_h Seaography:  then Drawling--_a Drawling-master _l an old
conger-eel, _f used to come once a week:  HE taught us
Drawling, Stretching, _b Fainting in Coils.'

  `What _l THAT like?' _p _n.

  `Well, I can't show it _s myself,' _a Mock Turtle _p:  `I'm
too stiff.  And _a Gryphon never learnt it.'

  `Hadn't time,' _p _a Gryphon:  `I _w to _a Classics
master, though.  He _l an old crab, HE _l.'

  `I never _w to him,' _a Mock Turtle _p _h a sigh:  `he
taught Laughing _b Grief, they used to _c.'

  `So he did, _9 he did,' _p _a Gryphon, sighing in his turn;
_b both creatures hid _4 faces in _4 paws.

  `And _t many hours a day did _s do lessons?' _p _n, in a
hurry to change _a subject.

  `Ten hours _a first day,' _p _a Mock Turtle: `nine _a
next, _b _9 on.'

  `What a curious plan!' exclaimed _n.

  `That's _a reason they're called lessons,' _a Gryphon
remarked:  `because they lessen _v day to day.'

  This _l quite a new idea to _n, _b _d thought it over a
little before _d made _e next remark.  `Then _a eleventh day
must _g been a holiday?'

  `Of course it _l,' _p _a Mock Turtle.

  `And _t did _s manage on _a twelfth?' _n _w on eagerly.

  `That's enough _6 lessons,' _a Gryphon interrupted in a
_m decided tone:  `tell _e something _6 _a games now.'



                            CHAPTER X

                      The Lobster Quadrille


  The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, _b drew _a back of _0 flapper
across his eyes.  He looked at _n, _b tried to speak, _u _j
a minute or two sobs choked his voice.  `Same as _5 he had a bone
in his throat,' _p _a Gryphon:  _b it set to work shaking him
_b punching him in _a back.  At last _a Mock Turtle recovered
his voice, _b, _h tears running _r his cheeks, he _w on
again:--

  `You may _k _g lived much under _a sea--' (`I haven't,'
_p _n)--`_b perhaps _s were never even introduced to a lobster--'
(_n began to _c `I once tasted--' _u checked herself hastily,
_b _p `No, never') `--_9 _s can _g no idea _i a delightful
_o a Lobster Quadrille is!'

  `No, indeed,' _p _n.  `What sort of a dance is it?'

  `Why,' _p _a Gryphon, `_s first form into a line along _a
sea-shore--'

  `Two lines!' cried _a Mock Turtle.  `Seals, turtles, salmon,
_b _9 on; then, when _s've cleared _1 _a jelly-fish _8 of
_a way--'

  `THAT generally takes some time,' interrupted _a Gryphon.

  `--_s advance twice--'

  `Each _h a lobster as a partner!' cried _a Gryphon.

  `Of course,' _a Mock Turtle _p:  `advance twice, set to
partners--'

  `--change lobsters, _b retire in same order,' continued _a
Gryphon.

  `Then, _s know,' _a Mock Turtle _w on, `_s throw _a--'

  `The lobsters!' shouted _a Gryphon, _h a bound into _a air.

  `--as far _8 to sea as _s can--'

  `Swim after them!' screamed _a Gryphon.

  `Turn a somersault in _a sea!' cried _a Mock Turtle,
capering wildly _6.

  `Back to land again, _b _f's _1 _a first figure,' _p _a
Mock Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; _b _a two creatures,
who had been jumping _6 like mad things _1 _q time, sat
_r again _m sadly _b quietly, _b looked at _n.

  `It must be a _m pretty dance,' _p _n timidly.

  `Would _s like to see a little of it?' _p _a Mock Turtle.

  `Very much indeed,' _p _n.

  `Come, let's try _a first figure!' _p _a Mock Turtle to _a
Gryphon.  `We can do without lobsters, _s know.  Which shall
sing?'

  `Oh, YOU sing,' _p _a Gryphon.  `I've forgotten _a words.'

  So they began solemnly dancing round _b round _n, every now
_b then treading on _e toes when they passed too close, _b
waving _4 forepaws to mark _a time, while _a Mock Turtle
sang _q, _m slowly _b sadly:--


`"Will _s walk a little faster?" _p a whiting to a snail.
"There's a porpoise close behind us, _b he's treading on _z
 tail.
See _t eagerly _a lobsters _b _a turtles _1 advance!
They are waiting on _a shingle--_y _s come _b join _a
dance?

Will _s, won't _s, _y _s, won't _s, _y _s join _a
dance?
Will _s, won't _s, _y _s, won't _s, won't _s join _a
dance?


"You can really _g no notion _t delightful it _y be
When they take us up _b throw us, _h _a lobsters, _8 to
                                                      sea!"
But _a snail replied "Too far, too far!" _b gave a look
                                                       askance--
Said he thanked _a whiting kindly, _u he _2 _k join _a
   dance.
    Would _k, could _k, _2 _k, could _k, _2 _k join
        _a dance.
    Would _k, could _k, _2 _k, could _k, could _k join
        _a dance.

`"What matters it _t far we go?" his scaly friend replied.
"There is another shore, _s know, upon _a other side.
The further off _v England _a nearer is to France--
Then turn _k pale, beloved snail, _u come _b join _a dance.

    Will _s, won't _s, _y _s, won't _s, _y _s join _a
         dance?
    Will _s, won't _s, _y _s, won't _s, won't _s join _a
         dance?"'



  `Thank _s, it's a _m interesting dance to watch,' _p
_n, feeling _m glad _f it _l over at last:  `_b I do _9
like _f curious song _6 _a whiting!'

  `Oh, as to _a whiting,' _p _a Mock Turtle, `they--_s've
seen them, of course?'

  `Yes,' _p _n, `I've often seen them at dinn--' _d
checked herself hastily.

  `I don't know where Dinn may be,' _p _a Mock Turtle, `_u
_5 _s've seen them _9 often, of course _s know _i they're
like.'

  `I believe _9,' _n replied thoughtfully.  `They _g _4
tails in _4 mouths--_b they're _1 over crumbs.'

  `You're wrong _6 _a crumbs,' _p _a Mock Turtle:
`crumbs _2 _1 wash off in _a sea.  But they HAVE _4 tails
in _4 mouths; _b _a reason is--' here _a Mock Turtle
yawned _b shut his eyes.--`Tell _e _6 _a reason _b _1
_f,' he _p to _a Gryphon.

  `The reason is,' _p _a Gryphon, `_f they WOULD go _h
_a lobsters to _a dance.  So they got thrown _8 to sea.  So
they had to fall a long way.  So they got _4 tails fast in
_4 mouths.  So they couldn't _x them _8 again.  That's _1.'

  `Thank _s,' _p _n, `it's _m interesting.  I never knew
_9 much _6 a whiting before.'

  `I can tell _s more than _f, _5 _s like,' _p _a
Gryphon.  `Do _s know why it's called a whiting?'

  `I never thought _6 it,' _p _n.  `Why?'

  `IT DOES THE BOOTS AND SHOES.' _a Gryphon replied _m
solemnly.

  _n _l thoroughly puzzled.  `Does _a boots _b shoes!' _d
repeated in a wondering tone.

  `Why, _i are YOUR shoes done _h?' _p _a Gryphon.  `I
mean, _i makes them _9 shiny?'

  _n looked _r at them, _b considered a little before _d
gave _e answer.  `They're done _h blacking, I believe.'

  `Boots _b shoes under _a sea,' _a Gryphon _w on in a deep
voice, `are done _h a whiting.  Now _s know.'

  `And _i are they made of?' _n asked in a tone of great
curiosity.

  `Soles _b eels, of course,' _a Gryphon replied rather
impatiently:  `any shrimp could _g told _s _f.'

  `If I'd been _a whiting,' _p _n, whose thoughts were
still running on _a song, `I'd _g _p to _a porpoise, "Keep
back, please:  we don't want YOU _h us!"'

  `They were obliged to _g him _h them,' _a Mock Turtle
_p:  `no wise fish _2 go anywhere without a porpoise.'

  `Wouldn't it really?' _p _n in a tone of great surprise.

  `Of course _k,' _p _a Mock Turtle:  `why, _5 a fish came
to ME, _b told me he _l going a journey, I should _c "With
_i porpoise?"'

  `Don't _s mean "purpose"?' _p _n.

  `I mean _i I _c,' _a Mock Turtle replied in an offended
tone.  And _a Gryphon added `Come, let's hear some of YOUR
adventures.'

  `I could tell _s _z adventures--beginning _v _q morning,'
_p _n a little timidly:  `_u it's no use going back to
yesterday, because I _l a different person then.'

  `Explain _1 _f,' _p _a Mock Turtle.

  `No, no!  The adventures first,' _p _a Gryphon in an
impatient tone:  `explanations take such a dreadful time.'

  So _n began telling them _e adventures _v _a time when
_d first saw _a White Rabbit.  She _l a little nervous _6
it just at first, _a two creatures got _9 close to _e, _0 on
each side, _b opened _4 eyes _b mouths _9 VERY wide, _u _d
gained courage as _d _w on.  Her listeners were perfectly
quiet till _d got to _a part _6 _e repeating `YOU ARE OLD,
FATHER WILLIAM,' to _a Caterpillar, _b _a words _1 coming
different, _b then _a Mock Turtle drew a long breath, _b _p
`That's _m curious.'

  `It's _1 _6 as curious as it can be,' _p _a Gryphon.

  `It _1 came different!' _a Mock Turtle repeated
thoughtfully.  `I should like to hear _e try _b repeat
something now.  Tell _e to begin.'  He looked at _a Gryphon as
_5 he thought it had some kind of authority over _n.

  `Stand up _b repeat "'TIS THE VOICE OF THE SLUGGARD,"' _p
_a Gryphon.

  `How _a creatures order _0 _6, _b make _0 repeat
lessons!' thought _n; `I might as well be at school at once.'
However, _d got up, _b began to repeat it, _u _e head _l _9
full of _a Lobster Quadrille, _f _d hardly knew _i _d _l
saying, _b _a words came _m queer indeed:--

    `'Tis _a voice of _a Lobster; I heard him declare,
    "You _g baked me too brown, I must sugar _z hair."
    As a duck _h its eyelids, _9 he _h his nose
    Trims his belt _b his buttons, _b turns _8 his toes.'

              [later editions continued as follows
    When _a sands are _1 dry, he is gay as a lark,
    And _y talk in contemptuous tones of _a Shark,
    But, when _a tide rises _b sharks are around,
    His voice has a timid _b tremulous sound.]

  `That's different _v _i I used to _c when I _l a child,'
_p _a Gryphon.

  `Well, I never heard it before,' _p _a Mock Turtle; `_u it
sounds uncommon nonsense.'

  _n _p nothing; _d had sat _r _h _e face in _e
hands, wondering _5 anything _2 EVER happen in a natural way
again.

  `I should like to _g it explained,' _p _a Mock Turtle.

  `She can't explain it,' _p _a Gryphon hastily.  `Go on _h
_a next verse.'

  `But _6 his toes?' _a Mock Turtle persisted.  `How COULD
he turn them _8 _h his nose, _s know?'

  `It's _a first position in dancing.' _n _p; _u _l
dreadfully puzzled by _a whole _o, _b longed to change _a
subject.

  `Go on _h _a next verse,' _a Gryphon repeated impatiently:
`it begins "I passed by his garden."'

  _n did _k dare to disobey, though _d felt sure it _2
_1 come wrong, _b _d _w on in a trembling voice:--

    `I passed by his garden, _b marked, _h _0 eye,
    How _a Owl _b _a Panther were sharing a pie--'

        [later editions continued as follows
    The Panther took pie-crust, _b gravy, _b meat,
    While _a Owl had _a dish as its share of _a treat.
    When _a pie _l _1 finished, _a Owl, as a boon,
    Was kindly permitted to pocket _a spoon:
    While _a Panther received knife _b fork _h a growl,
    And concluded _a banquet--]

  `What IS _a use of repeating _1 _f stuff,' _a Mock Turtle
interrupted, `_5 _s don't explain it as _s go on?  It's by far
_a most confusing _o I ever heard!'

  `Yes, I think _s'd better leave off,' _p _a Gryphon:  _b
_n _l only too glad to do _9.

  `Shall we try another figure of _a Lobster Quadrille?' _a
Gryphon _w on.  `Or _2 _s like _a Mock Turtle to sing _s
a song?'

  `Oh, a song, please, _5 _a Mock Turtle _2 be _9 kind,'
_n replied, _9 eagerly _f _a Gryphon _p, in a rather
offended tone, `Hm! No accounting _j tastes!  Sing _e "Turtle
Soup," _y _s, old fellow?'

  The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, _b began, in a voice sometimes
choked _h sobs, to sing _q:--


    `Beautiful Soup, _9 rich _b green,
    Waiting in a hot tureen!
    Who _j such dainties _2 _k stoop?
    Soup of _a evening, beautiful Soup!
    Soup of _a evening, beautiful Soup!
        Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
        Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
    Soo--oop of _a e--e--evening,
        Beautiful, beautiful Soup!

    `Beautiful Soup!  Who cares _j fish,

    Who _2 _k give _1 else _j two p
    ennyworth only of beautiful Soup?

  `Chorus again!' cried _a Gryphon, _b _a Mock Turtle had
just begun to repeat it, when a cry of `The trial's beginning!'
_l heard in _a distance.

  `Come on!' cried _a Gryphon, _b, taking _n by _a hand,
it hurried off, without waiting _j _a end of _a song.

  `What trial is it?' _n panted as _d ran; _u _a Gryphon
only answered `Come on!' _b ran _a faster, while more _b more
faintly came, carried on _a breeze _f followed them, _a
melancholy words:--

    `Soo--oop of _a e--e--evening,

                           CHAPTER XI

                      Who Stole _a Tarts?


  The King _b Queen of Hearts were seated on _4 throne when
they arrived, _h a great crowd assembled _6 them--_1 sorts
of little birds _b beasts, as well as _a whole pack of cards:
_a Knave _l standing before them, in chains, _h a soldier on
each side to guard him; _b near _a King _l _a White Rabbit,
_h a trumpet in _0 hand, _b a scroll of parchment in _a
other.  In _a _m middle of _a court _l a table, _h a large
dish of tarts upon it:  they looked _9 good, _f it made _n
quite hungry to look at them--`I wish they'd _x _a trial done,'
_d thought, `_b hand round _a refreshments!'  But _3 seemed
to be no chance of _q, _9 _d began looking at everything _6
_e, to pass away _a time.

  _n had never been in a court of justice before, _u _d had
read _6 them in books, _b _d _l quite pleased to find _f
_d knew _a name of nearly everything _3.  `That's _a
judge,' _d _p to herself, `because of his great wig.'

  The judge, by _a way, _l _a King; _b as he wore his crown
over _a wig, (look at _a frontispiece _5 _s want to see _t he
did it,) he did _k look at _1 comfortable, _b it _l certainly
_k becoming.

  `And _f's _a jury-box,' thought _n, `_b those twelve
creatures,' (_d _l obliged to _c `creatures,' _s see, because
some of them were animals, _b some were birds,) `I suppose they
are _a jurors.'  She _p _q last word two or three times over
to herself, being rather proud of it:  _j _d thought, _b
rightly too, _f _m few little girls of _e age knew _a
meaning of it at _1.  However, `jury-men' _2 _g done just
as well.

  The twelve jurors were _1 writing _m busily on slates.
`What are they doing?'  _n whispered to _a Gryphon.  `They
can't _g anything to put _r yet, before _a trial's begun.'

  `They're putting _r _4 names,' _a Gryphon whispered in
reply, `_j fear they should forget them before _a end of _a
trial.'

  `Stupid things!' _n began in a loud, indignant voice, _u
_d stopped hastily, _j _a White Rabbit cried _8, `Silence in
_a court!' _b _a King put on his spectacles _b looked
anxiously round, to make _8 who _l talking.

  _n could see, as well as _5 _d were looking over _4
shoulders, _f _1 _a jurors were writing _r `stupid things!'
on _4 slates, _b _d could even make _8 _f _0 of them
didn't know _t to spell `stupid,' _b _f he had to ask his
neighbour to tell him.  `A nice muddle _4 slates'll be in
before _a trial's over!' thought _n.

  One of _a jurors had a pencil _f squeaked.  This of course,
_n could _k stand, _b _d _w round _a court _b got
behind him, _b _m soon found an opportunity of taking it
away.  She did it _9 quickly _f _a poor little juror (it _l
Bill, _a Lizard) could _k make _8 at _1 _i had become of
it; _9, after hunting _1 _6 _j it, he _l obliged to write
_h _0 finger _j _a rest of _a day; _b _q _l of _m
little use, as it left no mark on _a slate.

  `Herald, read _a accusation!' _p _a King.

  On _q _a White Rabbit blew three blasts on _a trumpet, _b
then unrolled _a parchment scroll, _b read as follows:--

    `The Queen of Hearts, _d made some tarts,
          All on a summer day:
      The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,
          And took them quite away!'

  `Consider your verdict,' _a King _p to _a jury.

  `Not yet, _k yet!' _a Rabbit hastily interrupted.  `There's
a great deal to come before _f!'

  `Call _a first witness,' _p _a King; _b _a White Rabbit
blew three blasts on _a trumpet, _b called _8, `First
witness!'

  The first witness _l _a Hatter.  He came in _h a teacup in
_0 hand _b a piece of bread-_b-butter in _a other.  `I beg
pardon, your Majesty,' he began, `_j bringing these in:  _u I
hadn't quite finished _z tea when I _l sent _j.'

  `You ought to _g finished,' _p _a King.  `When did _s
begin?'

  The Hatter looked at _a March Hare, who had followed him into
_a court, arm-in-arm _h _a Dormouse.  `Fourteenth of March, I
think it _l,' he _p.

  `Fifteenth,' _p _a March Hare.

  `Sixteenth,' added _a Dormouse.

  `Write _f _r,' _a King _p to _a jury, _b _a jury
eagerly wrote _r _1 three dates on _4 slates, _b then
added them up, _b reduced _a answer to shillings _b pence.

  `Take off your hat,' _a King _p to _a Hatter.

  `It isn't mine,' _p _a Hatter.

  `Stolen!' _a King exclaimed, turning to _a jury, who
instantly made a memorandum of _a fact.

  `I keep them to sell,' _a Hatter added as an explanation;
`I've none of _z own.  I'm a hatter.'

  Here _a Queen put on _e spectacles, _b began staring at _a
Hatter, who turned pale _b fidgeted.

  `Give your evidence,' _p _a King; `_b don't be nervous, or
I'll _g _s executed on _a spot.'

  This did _k seem to encourage _a witness at _1:  he kept
shifting _v _0 foot to _a other, looking uneasily at _a
Queen, _b in his confusion he bit a large piece _8 of his
teacup instead of _a bread-_b-butter.

  Just at _q moment _n felt a _m curious sensation, _7
puzzled _e a good deal until _d made _8 _i it _l:  _d _l
beginning to grow larger again, _b _d thought at first _d
_2 _x up _b leave _a court; _u on second thoughts _d
decided to remain where _d _l as long as _3 _l room _j
_e.

  `I wish _s wouldn't squeeze _9.' _p _a Dormouse, who _l
sitting next to _e.  `I can hardly breathe.'

  `I can't help it,' _p _n _m meekly:  `I'm growing.'

  `You've no right to grow here,' _p _a Dormouse.

  `Don't talk nonsense,' _p _n more boldly:  `_s know
_s're growing too.'

  `Yes, _u I grow at a reasonable pace,' _p _a Dormouse:
`_k in _f ridiculous fashion.'  And he got up _m sulkily
_b crossed over to _a other side of _a court.

  All _q time _a Queen had never left off staring at _a
Hatter, _b, just as _a Dormouse crossed _a court, _d _p to
_0 of _a officers of _a court, `Bring me _a list of _a
singers in _a last concert!' on _7 _a wretched Hatter
trembled _9, _f he shook both his shoes off.

  `Give your evidence,' _a King repeated angrily, `or I'll _g
_s executed, whether _s're nervous or _k.'

  `I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' _a Hatter began, in a
trembling voice, `--_b I hadn't begun _z tea--_k above a week
or _9--_b _i _h _a bread-_b-butter getting _9 thin--_b
_a twinkling of _a tea--'

  `The twinkling of _a _i?' _p _a King.

  `It began _h _a tea,' _a Hatter replied.

  `Of course twinkling begins _h a T!' _p _a King sharply.
`Do _s take me _j a dunce?  Go on!'

  `I'm a poor man,' _a Hatter _w on, `_b most things
twinkled after _f--only _a March Hare _p--'

  `I didn't!' _a March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.

  `You did!' _p _a Hatter.

  `I deny it!' _p _a March Hare.

  `He denies it,' _p _a King:  `leave _8 _f part.'

  `Well, at any rate, _a Dormouse _p--' _a Hatter _w on,
looking anxiously round to see _5 he _2 deny it too:  _u _a
Dormouse denied nothing, being fast asleep.

  `After _f,' continued _a Hatter, `I cut some more bread-
_b-butter--'

  `But _i did _a Dormouse _c?' _0 of _a jury asked.

  `That I can't remember,' _p _a Hatter.

  `You MUST remember,' remarked _a King, `or I'll _g _s
executed.'

  The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup _b bread-_b-butter,
_b _w _r on _0 knee.  `I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' he
began.

  `You're a _m poor speaker,' _p _a King.

  Here _0 of _a guinea-pigs cheered, _b _l immediately
suppressed by _a officers of _a court.  (As _f is rather a
hard word, I _y just explain to _s _t it _l done.  They had
a large canvas bag, _7 tied up at _a mouth _h strings:
into _q they slipped _a guinea-pig, head first, _b then sat
upon it.)

  `I'm glad I've seen _f done,' thought _n.  `I've _9 often
read in _a newspapers, at _a end of trials, "There _l some
attempts at applause, _7 _l immediately suppressed by _a
officers of _a court," _b I never understood _i it meant
till now.'

  `If _f's _1 _s know _6 it, _s may stand _r,'
continued _a King.

  `I can't go no lower,' _p _a Hatter:  `I'm on _a floor, as
it is.'

  `Then _s may SIT _r,' _a King replied.

  Here _a other guinea-pig cheered, _b _l suppressed.

  `Come, _f finished _a guinea-pigs!' thought _n.  `Now we
shall _x on better.'

  `I'd rather finish _z tea,' _p _a Hatter, _h an anxious
look at _a Queen, who _l reading _a list of singers.

  `You may go,' _p _a King, _b _a Hatter hurriedly left _a
court, without even waiting to put his shoes on.

  `--_b just take his head off outside,' _a Queen added to _0
of _a officers:  _u _a Hatter _l _8 of sight before _a
officer could _x to _a door.

  `Call _a next witness!' _p _a King.

  The next witness _l _a Duchess's cook.  She carried _a
pepper-box in _e hand, _b _n guessed who it _l, even before
_d got into _a court, by _a way _a people near _a door began
sneezing _1 at once.

  `Give your evidence,' _p _a King.

  `Shan't,' _p _a cook.

  The King looked anxiously at _a White Rabbit, who _p in a
low voice, `Your Majesty must cross-examine THIS witness.'

  `Well, _5 I must, I must,' _a King _p, _h a melancholy
air, _b, after folding his arms _b frowning at _a cook till
his eyes were nearly _8 of sight, he _p in a deep voice, `What
are tarts made of?'

  `Pepper, mostly,' _p _a cook.

  `Treacle,' _p a sleepy voice behind _e.

  `Collar _f Dormouse,' _a Queen shrieked _8.  `Behead _f
Dormouse!  Turn _f Dormouse _8 of court!  Suppress him!  Pinch
him!  Off _h his whiskers!'

  For some minutes _a whole court _l in confusion, getting _a
Dormouse turned _8, _b, by _a time they had settled _r
again, _a cook had disappeared.

  `Never mind!' _p _a King, _h an air of great relief.
`Call _a next witness.'  And he added in an undertone to _a
Queen, `Really, _z dear, YOU must cross-examine _a next witness.
It quite makes _z forehead ache!'

  _n watched _a White Rabbit as he fumbled over _a list,
feeling _m curious to see _i _a next witness _2 be like,
`--_j they haven't got much evidence YET,' _d _p to herself.
Imagine _e surprise, when _a White Rabbit read _8, at _a top
of his shrill little voice, _a name `_n!'



                           CHAPTER XII

                        _n's Evidence


  `Here!' cried _n, quite forgetting in _a flurry of _a
moment _t large _d had grown in _a last few minutes, _b _d
jumped up in such a hurry _f _d tipped over _a jury-box _h
_a edge of _e skirt, upsetting _1 _a jurymen on to _a heads
of _a crowd below, _b _3 they lay sprawling _6, reminding
_e _m much of a globe of goldfish _d had accidentally upset
_a week before.

  `Oh, I BEG your pardon!' _d exclaimed in a tone of great
dismay, _b began picking them up again as quickly as _d could,
_j _a accident of _a goldfish kept running in _e head, _b
_d had a vague sort of idea _f they must be collected at once
_b put back into _a jury-box, or they _2 die.

  `The trial cannot proceed,' _p _a King in a _m grave
voice, `until _1 _a jurymen are back in _4 proper places--
ALL,' he repeated _h great emphasis, looking hard at _n as
he _p do.

  _n looked at _a jury-box, _b saw _f, in _e haste, _d
had put _a Lizard in head downwards, _b _a poor little _o
_l waving its tail _6 in a melancholy way, being quite unable
to move.  She soon got it _8 again, _b put it right; `_k _f
it signifies much,' _d _p to herself; `I should think it
_2 be QUITE as much use in _a trial _0 way up as _a other.'

  As soon as _a jury had a little recovered _v _a shock of
being upset, _b _4 slates _b pencils had been found _b
handed back to them, they set to work _m diligently to write
_8 a history of _a accident, _1 except _a Lizard, who seemed
too much overcome to do anything _u sit _h its mouth open,
gazing up into _a roof of _a court.

  `What do _s know _6 _q business?' _a King _p to
_n.

  `Nothing,' _p _n.

  `Nothing WHATEVER?' persisted _a King.

  `Nothing whatever,' _p _n.

  `That's _m important,' _a King _p, turning to _a jury.
They were just beginning to write _q _r on _4 slates, when
_a White Rabbit interrupted:  `UNimportant, your Majesty means,
of course,' he _p in a _m respectful tone, _u frowning _b
making faces at him as he spoke.

  `UNimportant, of course, I meant,' _a King hastily _p, _b
_w on to himself in an undertone, `important--unimportant--
unimportant--important--' as _5 he were trying _7 word
sounded best.

  Some of _a jury wrote it _r `important,' _b some
`unimportant.'  _n could see _q, as _d _l near enough to
look over _4 slates; `_u it doesn't matter a bit,' _d
thought to herself.

  At _q moment _a King, who had been _j some time busily
writing in his note-book, cackled _8 `Silence!' _b read _8
_v his book, `Rule Forty-two.  ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE
HIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT.'

  Everybody looked at _n.

  `I'M _k a mile high,' _p _n.

  `You are,' _p _a King.

  `Nearly two miles high,' added _a Queen.

  `Well, I shan't go, at any rate,' _p _n:  `besides,
_f's _k a regular rule:  _s invented it just now.'

  `It's _a oldest rule in _a book,' _p _a King.

  `Then it ought to be Number One,' _p _n.

  The King turned pale, _b shut his note-book hastily.
`Consider your verdict,' he _p to _a jury, in a low, trembling
voice.

  `There's more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,' _p
_a White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; `_q paper has
just been picked up.'

  `What's in it?' _p _a Queen.

  `I haven't opened it yet,' _p _a White Rabbit, `_u it seems
to be a letter, written by _a prisoner to--to somebody.'

  `It must _g been _f,' _p _a King, `unless it _l
written to nobody, _7 isn't usual, _s know.'

  `Who is it directed to?' _p _0 of _a jurymen.

  `It isn't directed at _1,' _p _a White Rabbit; `in fact,
_3's nothing written on _a OUTSIDE.'  He unfolded _a paper
as he spoke, _b added `It isn't a letter, after _1:  it's a set
of verses.'

  `Are they in _a prisoner's handwriting?' asked another of
they jurymen.

  `No, they're _k,' _p _a White Rabbit, `_b _f's _a
queerest _o _6 it.'  (The jury _1 looked puzzled.)

  `He must _g imitated somebody else's hand,' _p _a King.
(The jury _1 brightened up again.)

  `Please your Majesty,' _p _a Knave, `I didn't write it, _b
they can't prove I did:  _3's no name signed at _a end.'

  `If _s didn't sign it,' _p _a King, `_f only makes _a
matter worse.  You MUST _g meant some mischief, or else _s'd
_g signed your name like an honest man.'

  There _l a general clapping of hands at _q:  it _l _a
first really clever _o _a King had _p _f day.

  `That PROVES his guilt,' _p _a Queen.

  `It proves nothing of _a sort!' _p _n.  `Why, _s don't
even know _i they're _6!'

  `Read them,' _p _a King.

  The White Rabbit put on his spectacles.  `Where shall I begin,
please your Majesty?' he asked.

  `Begin at _a beginning,' _a King _p gravely, `_b go on
till _s come to _a end:  then stop.'

  These were _a verses _a White Rabbit read:--

        `They told me _s had been to _e,
          And mentioned me to him:
        She gave me a good character,
          But _p I could _k swim.

        He sent them word I had _k gone
          (We know it to be true):
        If _d should push _a matter on,
          What _2 become of _s?

        I gave _e _0, they gave him two,
          You gave us three or more;
        They _1 returned _v him to _s,
          Though they were mine before.

        If I or _d should chance to be
          Involved in _q affair,
        He trusts to _s to set them free,
          Exactly as we were.

        My notion _l _f _s had been
          (Before _d had _q fit)
        An obstacle _f came between
          Him, _b ourselves, _b it.

        Don't let him know _d liked them best,
          For _q must ever be
        A secret, kept _v _1 _a rest,
          Between yourself _b me.'

  `That's _a most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,'
_p _a King, rubbing his hands; `_9 now let _a jury--'

  `If any _0 of them can explain it,' _p _n, (_d had
grown _9 large in _a last few minutes _f _d wasn't a bit
afraid of interrupting him,) `I'll give him sixpence.  _I_ don't
believe _3's an atom of meaning in it.'

  The jury _1 wrote _r on _4 slates, `SHE doesn't believe
_3's an atom of meaning in it,' _u none of them attempted to
explain _a paper.

  `If _3's no meaning in it,' _p _a King, `_f saves a
world of trouble, _s know, as we needn't try to find any.  And
yet I don't know,' he _w on, spreading _8 _a verses on his
knee, _b looking at them _h _0 eye; `I seem to see some
meaning in them, after _1.  "--SAID I COULD NOT SWIM--" _s
can't swim, can _s?' he added, turning to _a Knave.

  The Knave shook his head sadly.  `Do I look like it?' he _p.
(Which he certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)

  `All right, _9 far,' _p _a King, _b he _w on muttering
over _a verses to himself:  `"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" _f's
_a jury, of course-- "I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--" why,
_f must be _i he did _h _a tarts, _s know--'

  `But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,"' _p
_n.

  `Why, _3 they are!' _p _a King triumphantly, pointing to
_a tarts on _a table.  `Nothing can be clearer than THAT.
Then again--"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT--"  _s never had fits, _z
dear, I think?' he _p to _a Queen.

  `Never!' _p _a Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at _a
Lizard as _d spoke.  (The unfortunate little Bill had left off
writing on his slate _h _0 finger, as he found it made no
mark; _u he now hastily began again, using _a ink, _f _l
trickling _r his face, as long as it lasted.)

  `Then _a words don't FIT _s,' _p _a King, looking round
_a court _h a smile.  There _l a dead silence.

  `It's a pun!' _a King added in an offended tone, _b
everybody laughed, `Let _a jury consider _4 verdict,' _a
King _p, _j _6 _a twentieth time _f day.

  `No, no!' _p _a Queen.  `Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'

  `Stuff _b nonsense!' _p _n loudly.  `The idea of having
_a sentence first!'

  `Hold your tongue!' _p _a Queen, turning purple.

  `I won't!' _p _n.

  `Off _h _e head!' _a Queen shouted at _a top of _e voice.
Nobody moved.

  `Who cares _j _s?' _p _n, (_d had grown to _e full
size by _q time.)  `You're nothing _u a pack of cards!'

  At _q _a whole pack rose up into _a air, _b came flying
_r upon _e:  _d gave a little scream, half of fright _b half
of anger, _b tried to beat them off, _b found herself lying on
_a bank, _h _e head in _a lap of _e sister, who _l gently
brushing away some dead leaves _f had fluttered _r _v _a
trees upon _e face.

  `Wake up, _n dear!' _p _e sister; `Why, _i a long
sleep _s've had!'

  `Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' _p _n, _b _d told
_e sister, as well as _d could remember them, _1 these strange
Adventures of hers _f _s _g just been reading _6; _b
when _d had finished, _e sister kissed _e, _b _p, `It WAS a
curious dream, dear, certainly:  _u now run in to your tea; it's
getting late.'  So _n got up _b ran off, thinking while _d
ran, as well _d might, _i a wonderful dream it had been.

  But _e sister sat still just as _d left _e, leaning _e
head on _e hand, watching _a setting sun, _b thinking of
little _n _b _1 _e wonderful Adventures, till _d too began
dreaming after a fashion, _b _q _l _e dream:--

  First, _d dreamed of little _n herself, _b once again _a
tiny hands were clasped upon _e knee, _b _a bright eager eyes
were looking up into hers--_d could hear _a _m tones of _e
voice, _b see _f queer little toss of _e head to keep back
_a wandering hair _f WOULD always _x into _e eyes--_b
still as _d listened, or seemed to listen, _a whole place
around _e became alive _a strange creatures of _e little
sister's dream.

  The long grass rustled at _e feet as _a White Rabbit hurried
by--_a frightened Mouse splashed his way through _a
neighbouring pool--_d could hear _a rattle of _a teacups as
_a March Hare _b his friends shared _4 never-ending meal,
_b _a shrill voice of _a Queen ordering off _e unfortunate
guests to execution--once more _a pig-baby _l sneezing on _a
Duchess's knee, while plates _b dishes crashed around it--once
more _a shriek of _a Gryphon, _a squeaking of _a Lizard's
slate-pencil, _b _a choking of _a suppressed guinea-pigs,
filled _a air, mixed up _h _a distant sobs of _a miserable
Mock Turtle.

  So _d sat on, _h closed eyes, _b half believed herself in
Wonderland, though _d knew _d had _u to open them again, _b
_1 _2 change to dull reality--_a grass _2 be only
rustling in _a wind, _b _a pool rippling to _a waving of _a
reeds--_a rattling teacups _2 change to tinkling sheep-
bells, _b _a Queen's shrill cries to _a voice of _a shepherd
boy--_b _a sneeze of _a baby, _a shriek of _a Gryphon, _b
_1 thy other queer noises, _2 change (_d knew) to _a
confused clamour of _a busy farm-yard--while _a lowing of _a
cattle in _a distance _2 take _a place of _a Mock Turtle's
heavy sobs.

  Lastly, _d pictured to herself _t _q same little sister of
hers _2, in _a after-time, be herself a grown woman; _b _t
_d _2 keep, through _1 _e riper years, _a simple _b
loving heart of _e childhood:  _b _t _d _2 gather _6
_e other little children, _b make THEIR eyes bright _b eager
_h many a strange tale, perhaps even _h _a dream of
Wonderland of long ago:  _b _t _d _2 feel _h _1 _4
simple sorrows, _b find a pleasure in _1 _4 simple joys,
remembering _e own child-life, _b _a happy summer days.

                             THE END
